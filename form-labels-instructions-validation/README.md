# Form Labels, Instructions, and Validation

## Introduction

In order for users to know how to fill out a form, the form has to be accessible. For the most part this is easy to do. Key concepts include:

- Labels for form inputs
- Labels for groups of inputs
- Instructions and hints, where necessary
- Error prevention
- Form validation

With all of these, information must be visible on the screen, accurate and meaningful, programmatically determinable, and programmatically associated with the appropriate form element or group.

The more interactive a form element or process is, the more attention needs to be given to accessibility with respect to:

- Focus management
- Setting and updating ARIA names, roles, and values, where necessary
- ARIA live announcements, where necessary

This module provides instruction and examples about each of these concepts.
