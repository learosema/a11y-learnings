# Proximity of Labels to Controls

## A label SHOULD be visually adjacent to its corresponding element.

If labels are too far away from their corresponding form fields, people using screen magnification may have trouble finding them or may have to repeatedly scroll back and forth to make the connection between the form fields and their labels.

## A label SHOULD be adjacent in the DOM to its corresponding element.

When screen readers are reading a page using browse mode, they read information in the order it appears in the DOM. If form fields and their labels are not adjacent to each other in the DOM, screen reader users may incorrectly associate fields and labels as they are browsing a page.
