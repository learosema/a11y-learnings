# Icons as labels

## Icons MAY be used as visual labels (without visual text) if the meaning of the icon is visually self-evident AND if there is a programmatically associated semantic label available to assistive technologies.

```html
<p class="center">
  <input type="text" aria-label="Search"> 
  <button id="search-button" aria-label="Search">
    <span class="fa fa-search"></span>
  </button>
</p>
```
