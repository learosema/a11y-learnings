# Labels

## Introduction:

All form inputs and controls need to have a label â€” a label that is understandable by all users whether the user can see the page or not. In this section, we will discuss the important attributes that go into making form labels accessible including:

- Labels must be meaningful, i.e., they must clearly explain the purpose of the field.
- Labels must be programmatically associated with their control.
- Labels must be visible at all times.
- Labels must be in close proximity to their control.
