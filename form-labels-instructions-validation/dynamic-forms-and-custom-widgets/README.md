# Dynamic Forms & Custom Widgets

## Introduction:

Standard native HTML form elements are easy to make accessible (with proper labels, descriptions, instructions, styling, etc.). Accessibility gets more challenging as web designs get more complicated and innovative, and as they deviate more and more from standard form elements and designs. The good news is that it is still possible to make dynamic forms and custom form elements accessible, if you do it right. This section describes some of the common design challenges and solutions for innovative forms.
