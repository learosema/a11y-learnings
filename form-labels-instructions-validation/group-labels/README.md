# Group Labels

## Introduction:

There are times when a group of related form fields require not only their individual labels but also a group label in order to provide all of the necessary context for the fields. A typical example is a group of radio buttons, each with its own label, that is also grouped together under a group label or question.

The concepts that make group labels accessible are similar to the concepts that apply to individual form field labels:

- Group labels must be meaningful, i.e., they must clearly explain the purpose of the fields they label.
- Group labels must be programmatically associated with the group of fields they label.
- Group labels must be visible at all times.
- Group labels must be in close proximity to the group of fields they label.
