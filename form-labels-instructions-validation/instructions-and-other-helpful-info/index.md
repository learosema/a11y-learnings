# Instructions & Other Helpful Info

## Introduction:

One of the easiest ways to increase the accessibility of forms is to help users avoid making errors before they even happen. It is important that instructions and other helpful information are provided to users to help them successfully complete a form online.

In this section, we will discuss ways in which instructions and helpful data can be provided programmatically to assistive technology users and visually to sighted users.

All in all, here's what we basically need to keep in mind when it comes to instructions and other useful information for forms:

- Ensure labels and instructions are clear and informative.
- Make instructions and advisory information available to assistive technologies.
- Clearly disclose constraints for form fields.
- Clearly identify required form fields.
