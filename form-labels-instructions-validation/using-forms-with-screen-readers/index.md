# Using Forms with Screen Readers

## Introduction:

Screen readers have different modes of reading web pages. There is the regular reading mode (or document mode), forms mode, application mode, and virtual cursor mode. Each mode has a specific purpose, and, generally speaking, you can be in only one mode at a time.

The reason for the different modes is to allow users to do a certain set of operations that are appropriate for the type of content they're accessing, or appropriate for the type of interactions they are engaged in.

In this section, we'll discuss how screen readers interact with forms and the differences between general reading mode (document mode) and forms mode.
