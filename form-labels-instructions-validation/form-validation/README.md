# Form Validation

## Introduction:

Despite the best instructions in the world, mistakes will be made in forms. An important aspect of a formâ€™s accessibility is how the errors are handled.

Several of the WCAG 2.1 Guidelines focus specifically on the effectiveness of alerting users to error states and helping to correct them. Some things to consider for form validation based on the guidelines are:

- Let users know of any input errors that prevent form validation or let them know if form submission was successful. When an error is made, if a screen reader user does not receive any useful feedback from their assistive technology, that is a really poor experience. Similarly, if a sighted user does not visually see what errors were made in the form, that is also a poor experience.
- Preserve as much correct information as possible.
- Display error messages in context for quick resolution.
- Give users enough information to let them know how to fix the errors. Error alerts must:
  - Be clearly stated
  - Provide actionable feedback messages
  - Draw attention and focus to their message
  - Be styled distinctively from form inputs
  - Be fully accessible
