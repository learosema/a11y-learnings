# VoiceOver (macOS) Configuration Options

VoiceOver is a built-in screen reader that is available with any new Mac computer and iOS mobile device. If you have a Mac, no installation is required.

## How to start and turn off VoiceOver

VoiceOver turns on and off with the keystroke Command + F5. When you turn VoiceOver on, you may be prompted to take the Quick Start tutorial. If you have never used VoiceOver before, it may be a good idea to go through the tutorial and be introduced to the keystrokes used in VoiceOver to interact and navigate. You can start the tutorial at any time by using the Control + Option + F8 keyboard command.

Keyboard commands for VoiceOver begin with what are called "VO keys". The VO keys for VoiceOver are Control + Option, which you press together along with one or more other keys.

## Adjusting VoiceOver options

### Turn off mouse cursor tracking

The VoiceOver cursor, or focus, is the thick black line that appears over items in focus. This focus may follow the mouse cursor, thus reading out loud everything under the mouse cursor. If you are testing with VoiceOver and a keyboard, it will be best to turn off mouse tracking. To turn off mouse cursor tracking, while using VoiceOver, enter the command Control + Option + F8 to open the VoiceOver Utility. Under the pop-up menu for the "Mouse cursor", select "Ignores VoiceOver cursor".

### Voice settings

There are two ways that you can adjust the volume, rate, pitch, and intonation of the VoiceOver voice. The first method is to use the keyboard command Control + Option + Right Arrow. When you use this command, the first setting you will hear is whichever setting was changed last. You can repeat the keystroke until you hear the setting you want to change. Once you have selected an option (rate, pitch, etc.), use the commands Control + Option + Up Arrow or Down Arrow to increase or decrease the value for that option.

The second way you can customize voice settings is through the VoiceOver Utility. Open the VoiceOver Utility using Control + Option + F8. Under the categories, select "Voices". In the Default pop-up menu, you can select a different voice for VoiceOver to use. Then to the right of the Voice pop-up menus, you can change the volume, pitch, rate, and intonation of voices in VoiceOver.

### Verbosity settings

You can change how much textual information VoiceOver reads by adjusting the screen reader's verbosity levels. To change the verbosity levels, open the VoiceOver Utility using Control + Option + F8. Select the "Verbosity" category, and choose "General". Proceed to modify the verbosity levels. If you need help with the options, use the "Help" icon (a question mark) to learn more about what the options are.

### Help and Command menus

Two menus you may want to reference as you learn to use VoiceOver are the Help menu and the Commands menu. To open the Help menu, use the Control + Option + H keystroke. You can use the Help menu to learn more about VoiceOver in general. If you just need keyboard help, you can use the command Control + Option + K. If you do not know or have forgotten a keyboard command for a task, you can reference the Commands menu. Open the Commands menu by using the keystroke Control + Option + H twice.
