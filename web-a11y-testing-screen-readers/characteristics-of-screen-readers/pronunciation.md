# Pronunciation

## Mispronunciations

Generally speaking, screen readers do a decent job of pronouncing words correctly, but they may get confused by homographs (words that are spelled the same yet have different meanings) when they have different pronunciations. For example, the word address can be pronounced "a-DRESS" or "AD-ress" depending on the context: "She will address that question tomorrow." vs. "My address is on the form." Another example is contract: "I will sign the contract." vs. "You will contract pneumonia if you don't wear a coat!"

For the most part, don't worry about mispronunciations. Don't misspell things on purpose to force a screen reader to read it correctly. If the user doesn't understand a mispronounced word, the user can listen to the word again, or listen to the spelling of the word.

## User customization of pronunciation

Some screen readers allow users to customize the pronunciation of words. This is completely out of the control of the web site owner, though, so it's not something you need to worry about or keep track of in any way.
