# Characters & Symbols

## Screen reader default settings generally read only some punctuation

Screen readers don't generally read commas and periods. Instead they pause briefly, much as a human would when reading commas and periods. There is more variation in the way screen readers read other symbols, such as dashes, semicolons, parentheses, etc. The JAWS screen reader tends to be one of the most verbose in its default settings. VoiceOver is one of the least verbose.

Screen reader default settings generally read only a few symbols
Screen readers are highly unlikely to read most non-alphanumeric symbols, such as math notation (unless marked up with MathML), emoticons, emojis, etc.

Here is a list of some of the safest symbols to use (though screen reader support may still not be universal):

- @ (the at symbol)
- & (ampersand, written either as & or `&amp;` in the markup)
- / (slash)
- © (copyright, written as `&copy;`)
- ® (registered, written as `&reg;`)
- ™ (trademark, written as `&trade;`)
- ¶ (paragraph, written as `&para;`)
- • (bullet, written as `&#8226;`)
- $ (dollar)
- € (Euro, written as `&#8364;`)
- £ (British pound, written as `&pound;`)
- ¥ (Yen, written as `&yen;`)
- % (percent)
- ½ (one half, written as `&frac12;`)
- ¼ (one fourth, written as `&frac14;`)
- ¾ (three fourths, written as `&frac34;`)
- ° (degrees, written as `&deg;`)

Other symbols not on this list are much less likely to be read accurately by screen readers.

## Screen readers allow customization of character and symbol "verbosity"

Most screen readers allow users to determine how much punctuation to read. The settings can range from all punctuation to no punctuation. The implication is that there is no standardized user experience that you can count on across all users and all screen readers. The good news is that most users don't change the default settings too drastically. Also, if a user chooses to change the settings, that is out of your control anyway, so it's generally not something to worry about.

That said, you should be aware that some meaning may be lost if either the screen reader or the user suppresses the reading of those items.
