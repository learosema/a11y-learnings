# Non-linear Navigation

## Screen readers allow users to navigate to headings, landmarks, and other features

Even though content is linear from a screen reader point of view, screen readers allow users to navigate by other elements, such as:

- Landmarks (sections of the overall design, including the header, navigation, main content, and footer)
- Headings
- Links
- Tables
- Form elements
- Graphics
- List items
- Iframes
- several other categories of semantic elements

## Screen readers require structural and semantic markup

The only way that users can navigate by these semantic elements is if the semantic elements are present in the markup in the first place. They can't navigate by headings if there are no headings (<h1>, <h2>, etc.), or if there are only fake headings (e.g., paragraphs with big bold text). The semantic markup has to be there, and it has to be well-designed.
