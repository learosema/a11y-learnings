# Screen Reader Modes

## Introduction:

Most screen readers have different modes that apply to different sets of circumstances. The two biggest categories of circumstances are:

- <b>Page navigation:</b> When the user needs to navigate around within the document, all kinds of keystrokes are available for a wide variety of tasks (e.g., H for headings, G for graphics, T for tables, etc.). This page navigation mode is also referred to as scan mode (in Narrator), browse mode, or document mode.
- <b>Input or interaction:</b> When interacting with an element—such as when typing in a text field, or when inside a custom JavaScript widget—it would be bad if the H key took users to the next heading, so screen readers suppress page navigation keystrokes under those circumstances. This interaction mode has a few variations and names, including forms mode, focus mode, and application mode.

Some screen readers have other modes too, but the distinction described above is the most basic one across the majority of screen reader brands.
