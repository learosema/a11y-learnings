# Document/Browse/Scan Mode

## Reading text

In document mode, or reading mode, screen reader users are able to read text, navigate by words, navigate by characters to hear the spelling of words, and so on. This is the default mode of most screen readers.

## Navigating by semantic elements

When users want to navigate by semantic elements—such as headings, landmarks, tables, graphics, lists, links, etc.—they can use the screen reader's keyboard shortcuts to go forward or backward through those elements.

In JAWS and NVDA, document mode or reading mode is the same mode that allows them to navigate by semantic elements.
In VoiceOver for macOS, there is no need to switch modes, because VoiceOver doesn't have the same concept of modes as other screen readers.

In Narrator, users need to enter into "Scan Mode" (by pressing Caps lock + Space bar) to navigate by semantic elements.

## Switching modes in screen readers

- NVDA: Insert + Space bar (switches between document mode and focus mode)
- VoiceOver for macOS: No need to switch modes
- Narrator: Caps lock + Space bar (turns Scan Mode on or off)
