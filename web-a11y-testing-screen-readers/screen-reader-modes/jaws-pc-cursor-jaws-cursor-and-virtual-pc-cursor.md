# JAWS PC Cursor, JAWS Cursor, & Virtual PC Cursor

## PC cursor

When using JAWS, the PC cursor is equivalent to the keyboard focus. In this mode, users can type, access menus, and so on. As users move from one item to the next, each item is highlighted (assuming the item has a visual focus indicator, which is not always the case).

To activate the PC cursor, press the Numpad plus sign (+).

## JAWS cursor

The JAWS cursor is equivalent to the mouse pointer functions.

To activate the JAWS cursor, press the Numpad minus sign (-).

## Virtual PC cursor

On web pages, the Virtual PC cursor is activated by default. It is similar to the PC cursor, but it is called a "virtual" PC cursor because web documents are read-only documents. The Virtual PC Cursor allows screen readers to interact with the text even though it is not editable.

Users can use the Shift + Arrow keys to select text on the web page, for example. As users move around with the Virtual PC Cursor, the items are NOT highlighted.

To toggle the Virtual PC Cursor on and off, use Insert + Z.
