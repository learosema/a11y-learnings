# NVDA (Windows)

Introduction:
NVDA (Non-Visual Desktop Access) is a screen reader for Microsoft Windows that is totally free, yet fully functional and portable; you can download it to your PC or to portable media such as a USB stick. It was initially released in 2006 by NV Access founders Michael Curran and James Tehâ€”blind computer programmers who believe passionately in universal access to computers.

Browser Compatibility:
NVDA + Firefox, NVDA + Chrome, NVDA + Edge
NVDA works well with Firefox, Chrome, and Edge. NVDA also has decent support for Internet Explorer, but the best testing combinations are NVDA + Firefox, NVDA + Chrome, and NVDA + Edge.
