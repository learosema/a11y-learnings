# Lists

## How screen readers treat lists

When reading a list, screen readers will typically announce the kind of list (e.g., "bulleted list" or "numbered list"), followed by the number of items in that list. Example: "Bulleted list with 5 items". Most screen readers also notify users when they arrive at nested lists (lists with sub-lists).
