# Landmark regions

## How screen readers treat landmarks

Most modern screen readers will say the type of landmark the user is in as soon as the user enters into that landmark. It might say "banner region" or "main region", for example.

When landmarks are present on a page, screen reader users can use them to navigate to various sections on the web page. Landmarks allow screen reader users to jump to the main content of the page, navigation areas, and information contained in the header and footer of the web page without having to tab through individual elements on the page. Landmarks provide screen reader users with another method to quickly learn about the content on the web page.
