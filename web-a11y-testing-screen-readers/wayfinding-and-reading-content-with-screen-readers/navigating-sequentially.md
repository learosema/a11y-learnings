# Navigating Sequentially

When a screen reader first interacts with a web page, it will read the entire web page if it is not interrupted. But those who use screen readers rarely allow the screen reader to read the entire page and use landmarks and headings to skim the page.

A screen reader user may find a landmark, heading, or other element of interest and read from that point on in the web page. Screen reader users may also choose to read a web page line by line or sentence by sentence. In the tables below, you will find some of the common keystrokes that can be used to interact sequentially with a web page.
