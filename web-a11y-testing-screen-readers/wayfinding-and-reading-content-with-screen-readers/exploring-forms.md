# Exploring Forms

Screen reader users often explore a form to find out what is contained in the form before filling it out. There are a number of ways that forms can be explored with a screen reader.

Screen reader users can tab to focusable form elements to hear form field labels; and depending on the screen reader, they can browse specifically by types of form elements. Some screen readers also go into what is called "focus" mode (sometimes also referred to as "forms" mode) to allow screen reader users to enter information into forms.

Focus mode, or forms mode, overrides the keyboard shortcuts that are available in browse mode so that screen reader users can type within form fields.
