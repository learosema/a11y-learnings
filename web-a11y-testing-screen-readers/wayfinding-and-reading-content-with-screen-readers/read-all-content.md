## Listening to a web page from beginning to end

It is possible to listen to an entire web page from beginning to end. To do this, usually all you have to do is:

- Start a screen reader
- Open up a web page

That's it. The screen reader will automatically read the page from beginning to end. The screen reader will usually start by reading the page title:

"MarsCommuter - Travel to Mars for Work or Pleasure!"

It then reads a brief summary of the major features on the page. It might say something like:

Page has 5 frames, 5 regions, 39 headings, and 153 links

Then the screen reader reads the content of the page, in the order that the elements appear in the DOM.

If you pause the screen reader before it finishes the page, you will need to use a keyboard shortcut to start it reading again.

- In JAWS, press Insert + Down arrow.
- In NVDA, press Insert + Down arrow
- In VoiceOver for macOS, press Control + Option + A
- In Narrator, press Caps Lock + Down Arrow or Caps Lock + Control + R.

## Most people don't listen straight through

It's worth noting that most people don't listen straight through an entire web page nonstop. They can if they want to, but that's kind of a waste of time usually. They're more likely to first navigate by landmark regions, headings, links, or some other method, and then listen only to the part they're interested in. The next sections explain how to navigate using these other methods.
