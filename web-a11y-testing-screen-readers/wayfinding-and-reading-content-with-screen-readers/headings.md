# Headings

## How screen readers treat headings

When reading an `<h1>` element, screen readers will say "heading level one", followed by the text inside the heading. They will announce other heading levels in a similar way.

Keep in mind that blind users can't just look at a web page and immediately understand its layout the way that a visual user can. Visual users can take in a lot of information about the page layout without having to read all of the content. Blind users don't have that luxury. Screen readers read in a linear fashion, which means listening to the entire web page, unless there is some other convenient way to get a "glimpse" of the page's layout and structure. It turns out that headings are a way to do that.

Screen reader users can use keyboard shortcuts to navigate through the heading structure of a document. Most screen readers offer a method to do most or all of the following:

## Method 1: List all headings

Some screen readers (like NVDA) show this in a tree view. Others (like VoiceOver) show all the headings in a flat list, along with the number of the heading level.

- JAWS with Chrome, Edge, Firefox, IE: Insert + F6
- NVDA with Firefox, Chrome, Edge: Insert + F7 (to open Elements List), then select Headings
- VoiceOver with Safari (iOS): Not available
- Talkback with Chrome, Firefox: Not available
- VoiceOver with Safari (macOS): Control + Option + U (to open rotor), then use left/right arrows to select headings
- Narrator with Edge: Caps Lock + F6

## Method 2: Navigate from one heading to the next

- JAWS with Chrome, Edge, Firefox, IE: H
- NVDA with Firefox, Chrome, Edge: H
- VoiceOver with Safari (iOS): Use the rotor to select headings (twist two fingers on the screen to left or right), then swipe down with one finger
- Talkback with Chrome, Firefox: Local context menu (swipe up then right), then select headings
- VoiceOver with Safari (macOS): Control + Option + Command + H
- Narrator with Edge: H (in Scan Mode only)

## Method 3: Navigate to headings of a certain level (e.g., to all `<h2>` headings)

This method is not used as much as the others, but if users want to explore headings by level, they can, in some screen readers.

- JAWS with Chrome, Edge, Firefox, IE: 1-6
- NVDA with Firefox, Chrome, Edge: 1-6
- VoiceOver with Safari (iOS): Not available
- Talkback with Chrome, Firefox: Not available
- VoiceOver with Safari (macOS): Not available
- Narrator with Edge: 1-6 (in Scan Mode only)
