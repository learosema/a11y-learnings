# Previous and Next Items

## JAWS

To navigate by elements or segments with JAWS, type the down arrow on the keyboard to go to the next segment (or up arrow to go backward to the previous segment). Note: It appears that JAWS defines segments in terms of its own buffer, rather than the actual markup in the code, so JAWS may pause in the middle of a sentence or at another seemingly random location.

## NVDA

Type the down arrow on the keyboard to go to the next segment (or up arrow to go backward to the previous segment). Note: It appears that NVDA defines segments in terms of its own buffer, rather than the actual markup in the code, so NVDA may pause in the middle of a sentence or at another seemingly random location.

## VoiceOver on iOS

Swipe right to go to the next element, or swipe left to go to the previous element. VoiceOver on iOS defines elements logically like VoiceOver on Mac, so it will pause at the end of a sentence, link, span, etc.

## VoiceOver on a Mac

Use Control + Option + right arrow to navigate to the next element, and Control + Option + left arrow to go to the previous element. VoiceOver defines elements in more logical groupings than JAWS or NVDA, so VoiceOver will pause at the end of a sentence, link, span, etc.

## Narrator

Type the down arrow on the keyboard to go to the next segment (or up arrow to go backward to the previous segment).
