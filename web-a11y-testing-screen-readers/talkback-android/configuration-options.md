# Configuration Options

## TalkBack installation

Not every Android device has TalkBack installed. If you do not have TalkBack installed on your device, then you will need to download the screen reader from Google Play.

## How to start TalkBack

### Settings

Steps to start TalkBack depend on the version of Android you have. The initial step is the same across all devices, though, which is navigate to Settings, then to Accessibility. After navigating to Accessibility:

For Android 3.2 and earlier: Check the Accessibility checkbox, then check the TalkBack checkbox.
For Android 4.0: Select TalkBack and set the TalkBack switch to On. Then go back to the screen before and start Explore by touch.

For Android 4.1 and above: Select TalkBack and set the TalkBack switch to On.
A confirmation screen will then appear. The last thing to do is to confirm and grant permissions to use TalkBack.

## Accessibility shortcut

Like VoiceOver on iOS, you can create an accessibility shortcut to turn TalkBack on. Under Settings > Accessibility, choose Accessibility Shortcut and slide the switch to On. You can now either turn TalkBack on or off by pressing the Power button until there is a sound or vibration, releasing the Power button afterwards, then holding two fingers on the screen until there is an audio confirmation that TalkBack is on (this may take a few seconds).

## Adjusting TalkBack options

### Note:

Some of the settings for TalkBack may differ from device to device and according to which version of TalkBack is on your device. The version number for TalkBack can be found under Settings > Apps > TalkBack.

### Speech settings

Under Settings > Accessibility > TalkBack > Settings, you will come across several categories of settings for TalkBack. In the Speech settings, you may find options for speech volume, pitch changes, options to turn on speech while the screen is off, and more. Select any of the options you would like to modify.

### Touch exploration settings

In the Touch Exploration settings, you can enable the Explore by Touch option and you can modify the default TalkBack gestures. With the Explore by Touch option, you can hear what is under your finger when you touch the screen. There may also be a tutorial available for you to go through to learn Explore by Touch. If you would like to change the default gestures in TalkBack, you can modify those under "Manage Gestures".

## Global and local context menus

There are two types of menus you can use in TalkBack to access settings and controls. The global context menu contains settings and controls that are applicable anywhere. You can open the global context menu by swiping down and then right. Once you open it, you can drag your finger over the menu items to hear them, then remove your finger to select the item you want. Options available in the global context menu include: read from top, read from next item, repeat last utterance, spell last utterance, and more.

The local content menu provides a list of settings and controls that only apply to a focused item. To open the local context menu, swipe up and then right. Again, drag your finger over the items to hear them and release your finger to select an item. Options available in the local content menu include: navigation options, links menu, and more.
