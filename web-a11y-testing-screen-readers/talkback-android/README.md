# TalkBack (Android)

## Introduction:

Some Android devices come with TalkBack pre-installed. Others do not, so you have to download TalkBack from Google Play. Once it is installed, it can read the operating system, web pages, and many Google apps. Like VoiceOver on iOS, it can read accessible third-party apps, but the majority of them were not created with accessibility in mind, so there are significant accessibility barriers.

### Browser Compatibility:

TalkBack + Chrome, TalkBack + Firefox

- Talkback works best with Chrome, and also works well with Firefox. If you try to use it with any other browser, it may work for some things, but not as consistently.
- Chrome is the recommended browser for current versions of Android. Prior to Android 7.0, Firefox is recommended.
