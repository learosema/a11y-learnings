# Accessibility APIs

## Introduction:

Every major operating system has some form of accessibility API, allowing screen readers to access key information about the objects and events available to the user. All APIs are different, but they all have the same goal of making the operating system—and the applications running on it—accessible to people with disabilities. An accessibility API can also often be used as hooks for programmers wanting to automate tasks or perform other non-accessibility operations.
