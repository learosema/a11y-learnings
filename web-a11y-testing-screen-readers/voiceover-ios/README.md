# VoiceOver (iOS)

## Introduction:

All iOS devices (phones and tablets) come with VoiceOver already pre-installed. VoiceOver is probably the most complete and most intuitive screen reader for mobile devices, at least up to this point. VoiceOver on iOS will read the operating system, web pages, and many of the Apple apps that come with the device. VoiceOver can potentially read any app on the device, as long as the app takes advantage of the accessibility API in iOS. Most third-party apps were not created with accessibility in mind, so there are significant accessibility barriers.

VoiceOver on iOS is similar to its desktop counterpart on the Mac, with some key differences:

- There is no subtitle window to see the text of what VoiceOver is saying in older iOS versions. But starting with iOS 13, there is a subtitle window.
- Instead of keyboard shortcuts, there are new swipe motions and gestures to learn.
- VoiceOver mobile does not provide the same kind of rich table navigation features as those available in a desktop environment. VoiceOver mobile will read the content of the cells, but it will not read the associated headers.
- The default delay on reading content associated by aria-describedby is short (about 1 second) compared to the inconveniently long delay (up to about 30 seconds) on VoiceOver for Mac.

### Browser compatibility:

- VoiceOver + Safari
  VoiceOver on iOS works best with Safari.
