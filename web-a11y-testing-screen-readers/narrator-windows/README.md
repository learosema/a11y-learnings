# Narrator (Windows)

## Introduction:

Narrator is the built-in screen reader that comes with Windows. Narrator has been around for a long time, but starting with Windows 10 Anniversary Edition, Narrator has matured significantly, making it a much more viable option for blind users than it ever was previously.

## Browser Compatibility:

- Windows Narrator + Edge
- Narrator works best with Microsoft Edge. If you try to use it with any other browser, it may work for some things, but not as consistently as with Edge.
