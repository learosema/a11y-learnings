## ChromeVox is a browser reader

ChromeVox is not a full-featured screen reader. It is a browser reader. It can only read the Chrome browser, not the operating system or any other software. The one interesting exception to that statement is on Chromebook computers. On Chromebooks, the operating system is Chrome OS, so ChromeVox does read the operating system in that case, but the number and kinds of applications you can install on Chromebooks is rather limited. On all other operating systems (Mac, Windows, Linux), ChromeVox reads only the Chrome browser and the web content displayed in it.

## ChromeVox is insufficient for testing interactive content

ChromeVox is a decent web reader, but it is still not as full-featured as JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, or Narrator on web content. ChromeVox does not read ARIA as well as other screen readers, which puts it at a disadvantage on today's dynamic web sites. ChromeVox is not commonly used at all—by blind users or by developers—but it can still serve as an effective testing tool for non-interactive web pages. Interactive web pages require a more sophisticated screen reader.
