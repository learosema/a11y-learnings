# Who Uses Screen Readers?

## Blind

The majority of screen reader users are blind, which includes people who cannot see at all, as well as people who may have some vision, but not enough to read a computer screen. Blind users typically listen to the audio output of screen readers.

## Deafblind

People who have both visual and auditory disabilities may use a screen reader with a refreshable braille output device, to allow them to feel the braille characters with their fingers.

## Low vision

People with low vision typically use screen magnification software to make it easier to read. For some people, the magnification is not enough, so they supplement the magnification with a screen reader. This allows them to both see and hear the web content.

## Reading disabilities

People with reading disabilities may find it easier to listen to content read out loud to them, rather than read it with their eyes.

## Cognitive disabilities

People with various kinds of cognitive disabilities may also find it easier to understand spoken words rather than written words.

## Eyes-free or hands-free environments

People with or without disabilities may use screen readers when reading things in eyes-free or hands-free environments.
