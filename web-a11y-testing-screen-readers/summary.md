# Summary

Screen readers have revolutionized the way people with disabilities can access computers and the internet, but screen readers can't magically make web pages accessible if they weren't designed to be accessible in the first place. Dynamic content, in particular, can be tricky to make accessible to screen readers. Testing with screen readers is essential.

Learning a screen reader can be a bit intimidating at first, but with a few basic keystrokes (see the [Common keyboard shortcuts](pdfs/desktop-screen-readers-survival-guide.pdf) handout), you can know enough to do basic accessibility testing. With practice, you can have a deep understanding of the challenges and solutions relevant to people who use screen readers.
