# Web Accessibility Testing: Screen Readers

## Introduction

### Why Test with Screen Readers?

Testing with screen readers is the only way to know if you've actually achieved screen reader compatibility, especially when it comes to dynamic content and custom widgets. Automated tools and checklists are important, but they have inherent limitations.

Learning a screen reader can seem intimidating at first, but by learning a few keystrokes and understanding how people use screen readers, you'll be able to test web content accessibility accurately and completely.
