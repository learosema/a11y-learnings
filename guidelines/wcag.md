# Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)

## Overview

- WCAG 2.1 published by the W3C in 2018
- Previous version of the guidelines were published in 2008 and accepted as an international ISO standard in 2012
- WCAG is technology-agnostic, applicable across all and future web technologies

## Level A, AA and AAA

- A: lowest level of conformance
- AAA: highest level of conformance
- Most set AA as internal standard because it's both achievable and meaningful without being too hard for developers
- important: all levels are required for at least some people with disabilities, don't ignore AAA items

## 4 Main principles (POUR)

### 1. Perceivable

Informations and UI components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
Ensure content is accessible to blind/deaf.

### 2. Operable

UI components and navigation must be operable.
Make sure everything is accessible by keyboard.

### 3. Unterstandable

Information and operation of UI must be understandable

### 4. Robust

Content must be supported by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technology.

## The 13 guidelines

### 1. Perceivable

- 1.1 provide text alternatives for non-text content
- 1.2 provide alternatives for time-based media
- 1.3 create content that can be presented in different ways without losing information or structure
- 1.4 make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from background.

### 2. Operable

- 2.1 make all functionality available from a keyboard
- 2.2 provide users enough time to read and use content
- 2.3 do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures
- 2.4 provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are
- 2.5 make it easier for users to operate functionality through various inputs beyond keyboard

### 3. Understandable

- 3.1 Make text content readable and understandable
- 3.2 Make web pages appear and operate in predictable ways
- 3.3 Help users avoid and correct mistakes

### 4. Robust

- 4.1 Maximize compatibility with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies

## Success Criteria and Conformance Levels

Every guideline is a list of Success criteria and has at least one success criterion.
Refer to the [official WCAG 2.1 spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) for the full list of success criteria.

## "Sufficient" and "Advisory" Techniques

- If you meet all of the "sufficient techniques" you pass the success criterion
- "advisory techniques" are a list of good ideas or best practices, but not critical
