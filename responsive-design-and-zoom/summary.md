# Summary

Even though responsive design was invented primarily for small screens and mobile devices, responsive design greatly benefits people with low vision who need to zoom in on content. Zooming in reduces the amount of screen real estate available, creating conditions essentially identical to the small screens of small mobile devices.

When the screen real estate is limited, it's best if the design can adapt by becoming simpler and "slimmer," fitting in a single column, rather than in two or more columns. Text should reflow to fit the smaller screen size, and horizontal scrolling should be eliminated, if possible. In short, the design should be optimized for viewing in mobile or zoom conditions.
