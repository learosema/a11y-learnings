# Responsive Design is Low Vision Design

Which of the following two versions of the same web page is easier for you to read?

![iphone 6 responsive](iphone6-responsive.png)

![iphone 6 no responsive](iphone6-no-responsive.png)

The first example is much easier to read, isn't it?

Even though both of these examples show the same exact web page on the same exact device, the first example includes some code to allow the design to respond to the smaller screen size of the device, allowing the text to be larger and more readable.

The second example does not include any code for responsive design. The text in the second example is too small for anyone to read comfortably. You might be able to read it, but it's not a pleasant experience.

## Responsive Design Greatly Benefits Users with Low Vision
Creating a good responsive design with functional breakpoints on all devices (mobile AND desktop) is one of the single most effective things you can do to help people with low vision.

In fact, you could kind of say that everyone has low vision, when it comes to mobile devices. The screens are so small, that if you try to fit a normal design on them, the text becomes extremely difficult or impossible to read. 

Everyone needs the design magnified. If you don't create a responsive design with larger text, users will need to zoom in on their own.

### Screen Magnifiers

People with low vision need to use screen magnifiers because they can't see things well enough otherwise. They might use the browser's built-in zoom, but they probably need a more complete solution that can magnify the operating system too, and not just the browser.

Windows, Macs, iPhones, and Android devices come with built-in zoom tools for people with low vision. There are also third-party zoom tools for desktop computers, such as ZoomText and Magic.
