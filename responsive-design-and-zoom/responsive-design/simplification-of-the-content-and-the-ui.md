# Simplification of the content and the UI

## Features of the content MAY be simplified, reduced in size, or eliminated when magnified or when viewed on small viewports.

On small viewports, the content in long or complicated web pages can be difficult or impossible to show on the screen at the same time.

If the meaning or understandability of the content suffers when not all of it is viewable on the screen at the same time, it can be appropriate to simplify the content itself, or eliminate parts of the content.

Similarly, it may be a good idea to reduce or eliminate decorative graphics or styles that are not essential.

## Features of the interface SHOULD be simplified, reduced in size, or eliminated when magnified or when viewed on small viewports.

As the viewport size shrinks, UI components may need to be resized or even eliminated in order to maintain the readability and an adequate click/touch target size of the remaining elements on the screen.
