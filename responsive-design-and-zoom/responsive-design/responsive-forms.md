# Responsive forms

## Forms SHOULD reflow to fill most of the width of the viewport, without causing any horizontal viewport overflow.

As the viewport size changes, ensure that form fields also adjust so that:

- Form fields do not overflow the viewport.
- Form fields and their labels are not separated by extensive whitespace that makes it difficult for people who use screen magnifiers to associate labels and fields.

## Note: 

On mobile designs, it's best if the label is above the field rather than to the side of it, because when you select the field, the OS zooms into the field, pushing the text off screen if it is to the side.
