# Responsive video

## Video elements SHOULD reflow to fill most of the width of the viewport, without causing any horizontal viewport overflow.

As the viewport size changes, ensure that videos also adjust in size so they do not overflow the viewport. One method for doing this is to constrain the maximum width of the video using the max-width:100% style on the container around the video.
