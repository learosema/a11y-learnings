# Responsive Design

## Overview

Responsive design was invented primarily to adapt to the small screens of mobile devices. It turns out that responsive design is one of the best things ever invented for people with low vision too. When people use the browser zoom function, the web content magnifies.

As it gets bigger, it will eventually reach the equivalent resolution of tablet or phone devices. If the design includes @media queries in the CSS, the same cut-off points for mobile devices will be fully functional for low vision users as they zoom in on their browsers.

Well-designed responsive designs are an ideal way to make content more usable for people with low vision, even if the primary reason for implementing a responsive design is for mobile devices.

One of the goals of responsive design is to ensure text is big enough to read on a mobile device. That's useful for people with low vision who need text magnified. Another goal is to eliminate horizontal scrolling on mobile devices, which is again useful for people with low vision. Responsive design and low vision design go hand in hand.
