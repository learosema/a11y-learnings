## Don't Disable Responsive Designs on Desktop Devices

Even though most people think of responsive design as a mobile design feature, responsive design works just as well on desktop browsers. In fact, it is on desktop browsers where responsive design can have its greatest impact for users with low vision. Desktop screens have much greater magnification abilities than mobile screens. The truth is that many users with low vision cannot see small mobile devices well enough to read them, even with screen magnification. In those cases, users would rely on a screen reader instead.

On a desktop computer, though, users with low vision can take full advantage of the larger screen and zoom in as much as necessary. As the users zoom in, the browser window will be smaller relative to the size of content, so the browser could potentially switch over to the mobile breakpoints, if the site is designed to be responsive on the desktop. That would be a good thing, because that would mean the content would switch to a single-column design, with text reflow to reduce horizontal scrolling, and with a simplified visual layout that is easier to work with.

To test to see if a site is responsive on a desktop computer, either resize the browser window to a smaller size or use the browser's zoom feature. On most browsers the zoom can be activated with Command + Plus (Mac) or Ctrl + Plus (Windows).
