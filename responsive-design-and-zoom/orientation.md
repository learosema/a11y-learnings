# Orientation

## Content MUST NOT restrict its view and operation to a single display orientation, such as portrait or landscape, unless a specific display orientation is essential.

Itâ€™s important to allow users the ability to choose their display orientation. For example, a wheelchair user might have their device mounted to their wheelchair, or someone with a disability that affects their hand or arm movement might have difficulty with rotating their screen.

There are exceptions to this rule in cases where a specific orientation is essential. For instance, a banking application to deposit a check might require landscape mode to take a picture of the check.
