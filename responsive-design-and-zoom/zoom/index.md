# Zoom

## Overview:

Users with low vision generally need to magnify the screen, either by simply zooming in on the browser, or, more likely, by using an assistive technology like ZoomText or MAGic to magnify the entire operating system. Be sure to allow users to zoom (don't disable zoom), and be sure to create a design that still allows full functionality and readability when zoomed in.
