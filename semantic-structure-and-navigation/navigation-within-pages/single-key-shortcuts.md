# Single key shortcuts

## If a single-character-key shortcut exists, then at least one of the following MUST be true: single-character-key shortcuts can be turned off, remapped, or are only active when the relevant user interface component is in focus.

This rule applies to upper- and lower-case letters, punctuation, number, and symbol characters.

Users who interact with their devices through speech often use words or strings of letters to do so. Applications and websites that use single-letter keyboard commands to activate functions can be frustrating or non-functional for these users, because dictating a word may have entirely unintended consequences. Giving users the ability to turn off, remap, or limit the activation of these shortcuts returns functionality to these users. Gmail is an example of a web application that uses character-key shortcuts: "e" archives a conversation, "a" replies-all, and "f" forwards it.

Additionally, a user may have mobility issues and may often accidentally hit keys on their keyboards. Adding a second, non-printable key (Ctrl, Option, etc.) helps these users to avoid unintended keyboard actions.
