# Table of contents

## A table of contents for the page MAY be included at the top of the content or in the header.

A table of contents helps with both understandability and navigation.

### A table of contents increases understandability

Putting a table of contents at the top of a page, or in the header of the page, can help users quickly get an idea of what the page is about without having to scroll down and read the content or skim through the headings. The table of contents acts almost as a summary of the main ideas of the page and allows users to preview and understand the main ideas in the content before reading it.

### A table of contents improves navigation

The table of contents allows users to quickly navigate to the sections within the page. This is particularly beneficial for keyboard users, which includes sighted people with motor disabilities as well as blind people. Sighted keyboard users benefit most of all, because unlike blind users, sighted keyboard users don't have access to the many keyboard shortcuts available in screen readers, such as the ability to navigate by headings.

## If a table of contents for the page is included, it SHOULD reflect the heading structure of the page.

In most cases, the most logical text to put in the table of contents for a page is the heading structure of the page itself. Aligning the headings and table of contents helps keep the page structure consistent and well-organized.

In some cases, it makes sense to include all headings of all levels. In other cases, it makes more sense to include only the main headings of the page. Including all the headings in the table of contents is more complete, but it also makes the table of contents longer, so there are trade-offs to consider.
