# Navigation within pages

With screen readers, most common types of semantic elements (landmarks, headings, lists, links, images, tables, iframes, etc.) are navigable with keyboard shortcuts, so the more attention you pay to semantic structure, the more easily screen reader users will be able to navigate the page.

Still, there are some things that don't have good semantic equivalents in HTML yet. There is no native way to tell users "You are here" within a paginated view of search results, for example. This section explains a few ways to accomplish that.

Also, sighted keyboard users don't have access to all of the keyboard shortcuts in screen readers, so there are actually very few ways for sighted keyboard users to navigate within pages. Providing a "skip navigation" link is one thing that can help.
