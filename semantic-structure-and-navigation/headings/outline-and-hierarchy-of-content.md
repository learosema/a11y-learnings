# Outline/Hierarchy of Content

## Headings SHOULD convey a clear and accurate structural outline of the sections of content of a web page.

Create the structure first, then style the headings as you see fit. Always think about the structure first, because screen readers and other assistive technologies pay attention to the structure, not the look and feel. If the default size of the headings is too big for the look you have in mind, use styles to change the size, rather than jumping down to a lower heading level.

## Headings SHOULD NOT skip hierarchical levels.
