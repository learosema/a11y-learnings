# Navigating Headings with Screen Readers

Keep in mind that blind users can't just look at a web page and immediately understand its layout the way that a visual user can. Visual users can take in a lot of information about the page layout without having to read all of the content. Blind users don't have that luxury.

Screen readers read in a linear fashion, which means listening to the entire web page, unless there is some other convenient way to get a "glimpse" of the page's layout and structure. It turns out that headings are a way to do that.

Screen reader users can use keyboard shortcuts to navigate through the heading structure of a document. Most screen readers offer a method to do most or all of the following:

## Method 1: List all headings.

Some screen readers (like NVDA) show this in a tree view. Others (like VoiceOver) show all the headings in a flat list, along with the number of the heading level.

### List all headings

- JAWS with Chrome, Firefox, IE: Insert + F6
- NVDA with Firefox, Chrome: Insert + F7 (to open Elements List), then select headings
- VoiceOver with Safari (iOS): Not available
- Talkback with Firefox: Not available
- VoiceOver with Safari (macOS): Control + Option + U (to open rotor), then use left/right arrows to select headings
- Narrator with Edge: Not available
- Window-Eyes with IE: Insert + Tab (to open Elements List), then alt + H to select headings

## Method 2: Navigate from one heading to the next.

### Navigate from one heading to the next

- JAWS with Chrome, Firefox, IE: H
- NVDA with Firefox, Chrome: H
- VoiceOver with Safari (iOS): Use the rotor to select headings (twist two fingers on the screen to left or right), then swipe down with one finger
- Talkback with Firefox: Local context menu (swipe up then right), then select headings
- VoiceOver with Safari (macOS): Control + Option + Command + H
- Narrator with Edge: H
- Window-Eyes with IE: H

## Method 3: Navigate to headings of a certain level (e.g. to all <h2> headings)

This method is not used as much as the others, but if users want to explore headings by level, they can, in some screen readers.

### Navigate to headings of a certain level

- JAWS with Chrome, Firefox, IE: 1-6
- NVDA with Firefox, Chrome: 1-6
- VoiceOver with Safari (iOS): Not available
- Talkback with Firefox: Not available
- VoiceOver with Safari (macOS): Not available
- Narrator with Edge: Not available
- Window-Eyes with IE: 1-6 then H
