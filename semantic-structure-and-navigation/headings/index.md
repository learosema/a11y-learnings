# Headings

## Introduction

### Headings Help with Content Organization and Navigation

Headings play a vital role in the accessibility level of any document, whether it is a Word, PDF, or HTML document. They are used for navigation by screen reader users and they provide a clear structure of a document which benefits all users, making it easier to scan through the content. And significantly, in the case of Word documents, properly styled headings make it very easy to auto generate a table of contents (TOC).

### Bonus Benefit: Headings Improve Search Engine Optimization

Headings improve search engine optimization (SEO) by highlighting the important parts of the web page and drawing attention to them. Be careful to not abuse the headings as a way to add search terms into the content though. If the headings contain more search terms than meaningful structural information about a page, the headings will not be useful to screen reader users and will defeat the purpose of using them for accessibility reasons.
