# Meaningful text

## Headings MUST be accurate and informative.

Headings should be descriptive enough to give users a good sense of the content they will find within that section of the document. When screen reader users pull up the list of headings, they will hear the level of the heading, plus the text within the heading, including alt text for any images inside the heading.

## Heading text SHOULD be concise and relatively brief.

There is no technical limit on the length of a heading, but a heading should be a short label for the section of content below the heading, to make it easy for users to browse the headings.
