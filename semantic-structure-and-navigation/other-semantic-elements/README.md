# Other Semantic Elements

## Introduction

There are other semantic elements in HTML that, in principle, could convey semantic meaning to screen reader users. Unfortunately, screen readers don't support all of the semantic elements — especially the less common ones — so blind users won't benefit from them, even if you use them correctly in your markup.

This section will show you which kinds of semantic markup you can and can't rely on to convey information, beyond the ones already covered in this module.

## In this Section:

- [strong and em](strong-and-em.md)
- [blockquote and q](blockquote-and-q.md)
- [code and pre](code-and-pre.md)
- [Strikethrough/Delete and Insert](strikethrough-delete-insert.md)
- [Highlighting (mark)](highlighting-mark.md)
