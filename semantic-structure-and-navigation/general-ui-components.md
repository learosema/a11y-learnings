# General UI Components

## In content implemented using markup languages, the purpose of User Interface Components, icons, and regions MAY be programmatically determinable.

This success criterion builds on 1.3.5 to programmatically identify the purpose not only of selected text inputs, but icons, regions of a page, and other user interface components. The page code would contain metadata that assistive technologies could interpret to give users additional information or modify the page for the user.

The success criterion is designed to help users customize their web experience. Users who find it easier to understand sets of icons rather than words would be able to place custom set icons on the screen through assistive technology. They could also hide extraneous regions of the page to help them focus on the content they want to see. This would be very helpful to users who rely on familiar symbols (that are customized to their preference) to navigate the web, such as people who may have difficulty with reading, processing, or maintaining focus.

The W3C does not currently have a recommendation on how to provide the additional metadata to make this customization achievable, so stay tuned.
