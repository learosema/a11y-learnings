# Frame title

## Iframes that convey content to users MUST have a non-empty title attribute.

### The iframe title MUST be accurate and descriptive.

#### Good Example: Meaningful Iframe Title

The iframe has a title that corresponds to the content in it.

```html
<iframe 
  title="Video: Specify the Language" 
  width="560" height="315" 
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qyjDrUV_el8" 
  frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
```

## Frames MUST have a unique title (in the context of the page).
