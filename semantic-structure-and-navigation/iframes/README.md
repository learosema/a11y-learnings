# Iframes

## Introduction

Iframes embed content from other web pages (usually hosted on other web sites). In simplistic terms, an iframe is kind of like a window in the middle of a web page that lets you view another page through that window. You essentially cut out a rectangle of the page with the iframe and expose the content of another page behind it.

Iframes can contain any kind of content, including advertisements hosted by a third party, videos hosted by YouTube or Vimeo, custom widgets hosted by a third party, and so on. Sometimes iframes are used only to contain JavaScript that is hidden from the end user.

From an accessibility standpoint, iframes require titles, so that screen reader users can find them and navigate to them. It's also worth knowing that all of the elements in the iframes (such as headings) are made available to screen readers, and essentially treated as part of the same overall document structure.
