# Parsing and Validity

## Introduction

It is always a good idea, though not always absolutely necessary for accessibility purposes, to validate your markup. Sometimes the impact of invalid code is minimal on accessibility. Other times it can be severe, such as when there are conflicting id values on the same page, leading a screen reader to incorrectly identify a label or a description for an element.

The more conscientious and careful you are with your markup, the better it will be overall for your web site, even if not all of your efforts have a direct effect on accessibility.
