# Navigating Tables with Screen Readers

## How Screen Readers Read Tables

The screen reader software notifies users that there is a table, and says how many columns and rows there are, e.g. "Table with 4 columns and 5 rows."

Upon hearing this, the user can decide to let the screen reader keep reading through all of the cells in regular mode, or the user can navigate cell by cell (sometimes referred to as "table navigation mode").

In regular mode, the screen reader starts in the upper left cell of the first row, reads across the row, then goes to the next row and reads it left to right, and so on through all of the rows. In table navigation mode, the user can navigate in any direction, using the appropriate keyboard combination in the screen reader.
