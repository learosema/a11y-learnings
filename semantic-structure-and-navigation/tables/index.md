# Tables

## Introduction:

Screen reader users can navigate tables almost like spreadsheets, going from one cell to the other in any direction. If the markup is correct on the table, the screen reader will read the table header out loud in addition to the data in the table cell, allowing blind users to understand where they are in the context of the table.

When tables are not marked up properly, screen reader users will probably find it difficult to understand the data relationships.
