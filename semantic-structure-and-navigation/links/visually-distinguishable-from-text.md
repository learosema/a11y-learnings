# Visually Distinguishable from Text

## Links MUST be visually distinguishable from surrounding text.
Sighted users must be able to tell the difference visually between link text that is within a paragraph or other block of text and surrounding text. If they can't tell the difference, they won't know what items are clickable, and they may miss important links. There is no need to change the default styling to meet accessibility best practices.

Color alone must not be used to distinguish links from surrounding text unless the color contrast between the link and the surrounding text is at least 3:1 and an additional differentiation is provided when the link is hovered or receives focus.

There are a few common ways to distinguish between links and text:

### Different Color plus underline

This is the default styling in browsers.

### Different color plus underline the links only on hover and focus

- some designers don't like underlined links
- not recommended, discouraged, people with low vision may not be able to distinguish text from link text
- only allowed if
  - there is at least 3:1 contrast ratio between linked text and text
  - the underline becomes visible on hover and focus (users tab to a link)

### Different background color on hover and focus

This technique can be used in combination with adding an underline on hover and focus.

### Add an outline or border on hover and focus

This technique can be used in combination with adding an underline and/or background color change on hover and focus.

### Placement in a navigation menu

Sighted users will understand that items are clickable menu items if the menu itself is styled in a way that makes it obvious it is a navigation menu. 

This method is somewhat difficult to pin down in terms of what it means, because there are many ways to design a navigation menu, all of which can look like navigation menus, and design trends change over time, so future navigation menus may look different from today's navigation menus.

The short version is this: if it looks like a navigation menu, the links are sufficiently distinguished from the surrounding text, and there is no need to underline the links.
