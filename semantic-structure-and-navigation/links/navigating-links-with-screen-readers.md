# Navigating links with screen readers

## Navigate through all focusable items

The Tab key: Perhaps the most common way to navigate through the links on the page is to simply use the tab key (or shift + tab to go backward), which causes the focus to land on every focusable element, whether it is a link, a button, a form element, or a custom control of some kind. If you're interested only in links, this isn't the best method, but it will work, if you don't mind a few extra keystrokes to get past the other focusable items.
