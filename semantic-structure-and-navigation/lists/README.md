# Lists

## Introduction

When screen readers come to a list, they announce that it is a list, and they announce how many items are in the list. This helps blind users get a sense of what the things are (lists) and how large they are (the count of items), which are things that sighted users realize just by looking at the lists. Giving lists the correct semantics helps give blind users an equivalent experience.
