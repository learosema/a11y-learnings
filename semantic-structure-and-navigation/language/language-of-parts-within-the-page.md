# Language of parts within the page

## Inline language changes MUST be identified with a valid lang attribute.

Identify any changes of language within the document. The lang attribute can be applied to block level elements (`<div>`, `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<table>`, etc.) as well as inline elements (`<span>`, `<a>`, `<strong>`, etc.).
