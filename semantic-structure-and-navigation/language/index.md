# Language

## Introduction

Most screen readers can read several different languages. Users select a default language when installing and configuring their screen reader, so if no language is specified in the HTML document, the screen reader will read the document in the user's default language.

Users who speak only one language will probably access websites only in their native language, so they won't experience any language issues. Users that speak more than one language though, such as many French Canadians, Europeans, or immigrants to a new country, will likely access websites in more than one language, and they will want to hear each language read correctly, with the proper accent and pronunciation.
