# Meaningful page title

## The page `<title>` MUST be accurate and informative.

The page title needs to correctly identify the identity or purpose of the page in a way that is useful to all users, but especially to screen reader users, who rely on the title to get a quick sense of the page without being able to look at it.

## If a page is the result of a user action or scripted change of context, the text of the `<title>` SHOULD describe the result or change of context to the user.

## The `<title>` SHOULD be concise.

There is no technical limit on the length of a page title, nor is there a formal restriction on `<title>` length in accessibility guidelines, but it is best practice to keep it as short as possible, without sacrificing accuracy or informativeness.

## The page `<title>` SHOULD be unique, if possible.
To avoid confusion — especially for screen reader users — it's best if the `<title>` of a page is unique within the web site. Sometimes it is not possible or not practical to check for the uniqueness of the page `<title>`, but the goal is to give pages titles that allow for easy and accurate identification.

Unique information SHOULD come first in the `<title>`.

# The page `<title>` SHOULD match (or be very similar to) the top heading in the main content.

Both the title (`<title>`) and the top heading in the main content (ideally marked with `<h1>`) serve essentially the same purpose: to give the page a title. With this in mind, it usually makes sense to match the page title and the top heading with identical text, or at least very similar text. There is some room for slight variations. For example, you might put the website brand at the end of the page title but not in the main heading for the content. Redundancy is a good thing in this case, because it allows users to see the page title whether they're viewing the tabs in a browser, listening to a page load with a screen reader (the title is the first thing screen readers read), or reading through the main content.
