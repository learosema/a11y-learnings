# Page Title

## Introduction

### The Page `<title>` is the First Thing Screen Reader Users Hear

The `<title>` of the page is critical, because it is the first thing a screen reader user hears. Blind users cannot glance quickly at the content of a web page to see what the page is about, so they rely on the page title to give them this information. Web pages without titles waste the time of screen reader users, because they force users to navigate through the web page — past the main menu and into the content — to find out what the page is about.

### Extra Benefit: Page Titles Improve Search Engine Optimization

Search engines and site search tools also use the page title when displaying search results. Effective titles help users quickly sift through the search results to identify the content they need. In this sense, good page titles are an important component of search engine optimization (SEO) in addition to accessibility.
