# Everyone Is Different

## When in Doubt, Consider Personal Preferences

The etiquette discussed here is the "preferred" behavior when interacting with people with disabilities, but it is important to note that what is considered appropriate differs from person to person.

For example, some people with disabilities may find the term "handicapped" offensive, but others may not be bothered by the term. If there is any doubt in the language used towards a person with a disability, it is best to ask that person what he or she prefers. Try to remember his or her preferences while in their presence.
