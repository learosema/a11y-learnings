# Disability Etiquette

## People with Disabilities Are Real People

People with disabilities are not conditions. They are people. They have hopes, dreams, good days, bad days, positive qualities, and flaws just like everybody else. If you first think of them as people, it's not so hard to figure out how to act around them because you already know how to act around other people (or at least we hope you do!).

Recognize them as individuals, and the rest will flow naturally, for the most part.

Still, there are a few things that you may wonder about, and you probably don't want to offend anyone, so this section will give some general guidance in terms of disability etiquette, or in other words, how to act around people with disabilities.
