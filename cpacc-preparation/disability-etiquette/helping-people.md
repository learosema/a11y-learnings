# Helping People with Disabilities

## Don't Assume People with Disabilities Need Help

If there is doubt, ask the person with a disability if he or she needs any assistance. Do not assume the person needs help or try to help the person without permission. If the person rejects the offer to help, do not take offense.

The person may be trying to see if he or she can perform a task or technique, or the person may be trying to learn something new altogether. Helping a person without his or her permission may startle the person or may throw him or her off balance.

## Offer Help When it is Truly Needed

Of course, if it's truly obvious that someone needs help—like a blind person who may have unknowingly dropped something—offer help! Don't pretend nothing happened, and don't make life more difficult for them just because you're afraid of offending them.

## Say "Hello"

One thing you can do that won't be considered offensive by anyone is to simply say "hello," and perhaps ask them how they're doing, or some other neutral question. If they don't respond by asking for help, they probably don't need help, and that's ok. There's nothing wrong with a friendly "hello" for no reason other than to acknowledge a person's presence.
