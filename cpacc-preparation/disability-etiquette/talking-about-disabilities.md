## Talking About People with Disabilities

## Use "People First" Language

If a person's disability must be mentioned either in conversation or in writing, reference the person first, then his or her disability. Instead of referring to someone as an epileptic, say "a person with epilepsy" or "John, who has epilepsy...". The table below provides examples of what is considered inappropriate and what is considered appropriate when addressing people with disabilities.

## Note:

Not every country or geographic region interprets the idea of "people first" language in quite the same way. In the United States, most people prefer to say "person with a disability," (based on the logic that you are saying "person" first, thus emphasizing "person") but in the UK it is often considered better to say "disabled person" (based on the logic that the word "person" is the last word you hear, which makes it the most memorable and meaningful term).

If it sounds strange to come to opposite word orders based on the same original logic, it is, but that's just the way language works sometimes.

Don't get too hung up on the regional differences. Pay attention to them if you're traveling or talking to people from different regions, but even if you don't get the regional differences quite right, as long as you're emphasizing the personhood of the individual in all other aspects of the conversation, you'll probably be alright and you won't come across as offensive.
