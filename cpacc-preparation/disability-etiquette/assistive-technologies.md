# Assistive Technologies

## Respect Personal Space

When in the company of people who use assistive devices such as wheelchair or a cane, it is important not to touch the assistive device. People with disabilities consider these assistive devices part of their personal space. Never touch, lean on, or pick up a person's assistive device.
