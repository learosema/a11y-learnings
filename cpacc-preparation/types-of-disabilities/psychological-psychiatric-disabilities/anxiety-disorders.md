# Anxiety Disorders

Anxiety disorders is the most common group of mental illnesses, or psychological disabilities. People with anxiety disorders persistently fear or worry about certain situations or objects. People will tend to avoid the situations or objects that provoke severe anxious reactions. These reactions are uncontrollable and can greatly affect a person's way of living. Common types of anxiety disorders include the following:

## Panic Disorder

Panic Disorder is anxiety disorder that causes feelings of terror and impending doom. People who have panic disorder may experience symptoms that closely resemble a heart attack at any time: a fast heart rate, difficulty breathing (hyperventilation), chest pain and dizziness.

## Phobias

Phobias are strong, excessive, paralyzing fears of particular objects or situations. Examples include claustrophobia, a fear of enclosed areas; arachnophobia, a fear of spiders and other arachnids; and social phobia, which may be a broad social fear or a specific social fear like talking to people or eating and drinking in front of people. Those who experience phobias may experience one or a combination of panic symptoms like a strong need to run away, a rapid heart rate, or difficulty breathing.

## Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, or PTSD, is an anxiety disorder that may occur after a person has been exposed to a terrifying or traumatic event. Acts of violence, war, natural disasters, and other life-threatening events may cause PTSD. People with PTSD may have nightmares, flashbacks of the event, feel as if they are experiencing the event again, and may have feelings of worry, anger, sadness or guilt. Signs of PTSD may appear right after the traumatic event or when a significant amount of time has passed since the event's occurrence.

## Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder

Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder is an anxiety disorder where a person has perpetually upsetting, distressing thoughts called obsessions. To alleviate the obsessions, a person will perform repeated, intentional acts called compulsions. For instance, if a person has a fear of germs, the person will repeatedly wash his or her hands or repeatedly clean his or her room.
