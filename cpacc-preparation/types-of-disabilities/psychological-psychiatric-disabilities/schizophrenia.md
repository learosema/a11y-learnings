# Schizophrenia

Schizophrenia is an extremely complex disorder. The causes of schizophrenia are unknown, but theories suggest that genetics and biology may be factors. Experiences with this disorder are generally categorized into two groups: "positive" and "negative." Positive schizophrenia experiences involve hallucinations and delusions. People with positive schizophrenia see things and hear voices. Negative schizophrenia experiences involve a lack of motivation, a dreary mood, and isolating oneself from society. Additionally, people with schizophrenia experience difficulty expressing themselves, attention and memory deficits, and trouble controlling their movements.

In the following video, mental health experts Dr. Paris Williams, Professor Elyn Saks, and Debra Lampshire, share their personal experiences with schizophrenia along with how they are debunking myths surrounding the disorder in their field.

[Video Title: Surviving Schizophrenia]

[DR. PARIS WILLIAMS:] There needs to be that idea that there's some light at the end of this tunnel.

[PROFESSOR ELYN SAKS:] There are people out there who have Schizophrenia and are doing well.

[DEBRA LAMPSHIRE:] The reality is that the majority of people get on, and get on with their lives and it's just a small portion of their lives.

Yeah, I work at Auckland University. I'm called a Professional Teaching Fellow and I would cover all areas of mental health. When I came into mental health it wasn't by choice, it was because I was committed.

[LAMPSHIRE SPEAKING TO CLASS:] I first started hearing voices when I was about five or six years old. After a while, I'm hearing the voices of demons. I believed I was possessed and I used to cut myself to try and get the demons out.

[SAKS:] Everybody becomes psychotic in his or her own way. For me I have delusions, sometimes bizarre delusions, like that I’ve killed hundreds of thousands of people with my thoughts, or a nuclear explosion’s going off in my head. I think Schizophrenia is still probably the most stigmatized, and I don't think we do well enough trying to incentivize people to really try to do well. I think too many people say, you know, lower your expectations.

[WILLIAMS:] Kind of in a nut shell, I basically had a pretty painful childhood, and I have what I would call essentially kind of a break down, really confusing, kind of wild, kind of beliefs, what you would kind of call paranoia, delusions of grandeur. Bit by bit I worked through it. I mean, there’s a lot of different ways to think of recovery, but I think the most important thing is to recognize that there is definitely hope and strong possibility of moving into a better and better life, and life that really is enjoyable.

[LAMPSHIRE in INTERVIEW:] It's just normal people dealing with normal human emotions, probably just experience them in a very extreme way.

[SAKS:] There is a lot of stigma and a lot of misinformation. I think people believe that people with Schizophrenia can't live independently, and can't work, or are unlikely to get married, and are going to basically sit in a day room watching a blaring TV at best. At worst, they're going to go out and shoot up a movie theatre and kill lots of people. So, there’s a lot of negative stereotypes, and that's hard for those of us who suffer with those illnesses to think, you know, this person is scared of me, how horrible.

[LAMPSHIRE:] I never speak to my diagnosis at all. In my private or my professional life, I would never name it. For me, to categorize somebody in that way is far too limiting. And even in mental health itself, the diagnosis is highly contentious. What is this thing that we're calling people being psychotic etcetera, etcetera, and the social, and personal, and professional consequences of doing that to people? I would think that if I was to declare my diagnosis to people that it would be almost impossible to cultivate relationships.

[WILLIAMS:] When we talk about these mental disorders, I think the idea of hope is really important. Here is someone in a dark place, in a painful place. And there needs to be that idea that there’s some light at the end of this tunnel.

[LAMPSHIRE:] First, I had to believe that things could be different, and when I started to experience a difference, that's when I started to believe. And then I started to realize that I could have the life that I wanted, and I just had to work at it. So, life for me now is, I've got all the things that I never thought I would achieve and all the things that I was told that I would never have. I managed to get married and have three children. I just do ordinary things.

[WILLIAMS:] We don't have much control over inner experiences like feelings, sensations, thoughts. We actually have a lot less control than most of us realize. But what we do have fairly good control over, including someone in psychosis, is what we're doing with our body and where I put my attention. And it is hard at first, especially if you're experiencing extreme states, yet almost anyone can actually learn how to do this.

[LAMPSHIRE:] What I have the opportunity to see is people work through their issues and go out and have the life that they choose for themselves, you know, get married, have children, have jobs, go and get the groceries. You know, people have been written off in lots of ways by the system, but also by our community, as well. And they are just getting on with their lives. There is nothing as satisfying to see people doing that.
