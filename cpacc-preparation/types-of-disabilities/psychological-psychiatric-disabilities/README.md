# Psychological/Psychiatric Disabilities

Psychological, or psychiatric disabilities, encompass a vast range of emotional and mental conditions. These conditions are first diagnosed as "mental illness". When the mental illness disorder impacts daily major life activities, it then becomes a disability. Examples of psychological disabilities include depression, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, and schizophrenia.

Trauma, chemical imbalances, genetic factors, and social factors may cause a psychological disability. People with psychological disabilities may experience their disability over the course of many years, and signs of their psychological disability may have unpredictable patterns. The type of disorder, severity, symptoms, and duration differ from person to person. Treatment of these conditions include counseling, psychotherapy, medications, and self-help methods.

The types of psychological disabilities we will discuss in the section are: anxiety disorders, mood disorders, schizophrenia, and some other disorders.
