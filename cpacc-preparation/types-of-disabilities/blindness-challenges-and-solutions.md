# Challenges and Solutions for people who are blind

## Learning goals

The CPACC exam will ask you questions that show you know how to:

1. Identify accessibility challenges that people who are blind experience.
2. Match the challenges with appropriate:
  - Assistive technologies (products or items that people can use)
  - Adaptive strategies (methods to work around or avoid the challenges)

## Blindness: Examples of Challenges and Solutions

### Information Communication Technology (ICT)

#### Challenge: Cannot see digital or electronic interfaces (computers, automated teller machines (ATMs), mobile devices, airport kiosks, televisions, printers, copiers, phones, GPS devices, etc.)

- Screen readers can read interfaces and content out loud to users by converting digital text to synthesized speech, but only if they have been designed to be accessible. Screen readers do not announce text styles such as font, color, size, bold, and italic.
- Self-voicing interfaces and applications can communicate to users without the need for a screen reader, but these are appropriate mostly for broadcasting information, because they usually do not interact with the interface or content as screen readers do.
- Refreshable braille output devices use screen readers to convert digital text to braille. These devices are typically expensive, and only a minority of blind people know how to read braille.

#### Challenge: Cannot use screen readers on digital content and interfaces not designed with accessibility in mind

- Interface designers and content authors can edit the markup to make it compatible with the assistive technologies used by blind people.

### Architecture & Built Environment

#### Challenge: Cannot see when walking

- Canes help blind people feel their surroundings as they walk.
- Service animals (e.g. "Seeing Eye" dogs), trained to assist blind people, help them navigate their surroundings.
- GPS-based walking instructions with an audio interface, either automated or via a remote human navigator.
- Raised tiles on the ground to indicate the edge of a platform, a pathway along a sidewalk, the beginning of a staircase, etc.
- Eliminate low-hanging architectural features that a blind person could bump into
- Clear pathways without obstructions in hallways, sidewalks.

#### Challenge: Cannot see signs or other text on buildings or other areas in the built environment

- Map and geolocation applications on mobile devices can announce the names and descriptions of buildings and other location-related information.
- Braille labels and descriptions on entrances, rooms, bathrooms, historical markers, and other points of interest can allow blind people to explore and understand their surroundings, as long as the person knows braille, and as long as the braille labels are easy to find.
- Tactile models of the exterior of buildings, or of floorplans of the interior of buildings help blind people form a mental map of their surroundings.

### Consumer & Industrial Products

#### Challenge: Cannot see or feel the controls on flat interfaces on consumer devices such as microwaves, ovens, dishwashers, etc.

- Alternative interfaces with knobs or other tactile controls
- Audio interfaces
- Remote control through applications on mobile devices
  
#### Challenge: Cannot read the text on the containers or packaging for consumer items such as medicine, toothpaste, shampoo, sunscreen, hand cream, personal care products, foods, drinks, candy

- Embossed braille (or braille stickers) on packaging and product containers help consumers identify items both in the store and after purchase.

#### Challenge: Cannot read money to determine its value

- Applications on mobile devices can photograph the money and read the value to blind people.
- Paper bills and coins could be manufactured in different sizes, shapes, or textures to allow blind people to distinguish the value based on touch.
- Non-cash systems of payment can allow blind people to make financial transactions via computers, mobile devices, or on-site payment hardware with screen readers or self-voicing output.

#### Challenge: Cannot read books, magazines, posters, postal mail, or other printed materials

- Optical character recognition software can convert scanned images of text into digital text readable by screen readers. The accuracy of the conversion depends on the quality of the original document, as well as font choices, line spacing, and the quality of the conversion software itself.
- Information can be placed online or in other digital formats to allow blind people to read the materials using their own assistive technologies.
