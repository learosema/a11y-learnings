# Challenges and Solutions for People who have Mobility, Flexibility, and Body Structure Disabilities

## Learning Goals

The CPACC exam will ask you questions that show you know how to:

1. Identify accessibility challenges that people who have motor disabilities experience.
2. Match the challenges with appropriate:
  - Assistive technologies (products or items that people can use)
  - Adaptive strategies (methods to work around or avoid the challenges)

## Motor Disabilities: Challenges and Solutions

### Information Communication Technology (ICT)

#### Challenge: May be unable to use a mouse due to difficulty or inability to use hands

- Alternative keyboards, mouth sticks, single switch devices, speech recognition software and eye tracking technologies enable users to use a computer without the need for a mouse
- Developers and designers can ensure digital content is accessible using keyboard devices

#### Challenge: May need more time to interact with digital content and interfaces due to slower movements

- Interface designers and developers can alert users to session timeouts and provide users with a way to adjust the time, extend the time or turn off the time limit

### Architecture & Built Environment

#### Challenge: Wheelchair users are unable to use steps

- For building entrances, accessible ramps in addition to steps should be provided, and accessible parking should be provided
- For steps within buildings, ensure that ramps and elevators are provided and accessible
- Ensure that accessible routes outside and within the building are labeled and clearly identifiable

#### Challenge: Wheelchairs users may be unable to navigate through tight spaces

- Doors, hallways, rooms, and restrooms should be wide enough for everyone, including wheelchair users, to use
- All corridors and routes should be unobstructed

#### Challenge: May have difficulty using hands or arms to open doors

- Provide automatic doors or doors than can be opened using a large button
- Equip doors with lever-type handles/doorknobs for easier opening or closing

#### Challenge: May encounter seating that is too small or at the wrong height

- Ensure that seating can accommodate a variety of body sizes

### Consumer & Industrial Products

#### Challenge: May be unable to turn pages of books, magazines, information pamphlets, or other printed materials

- Consider providing printed materials in a digital format that may allow people to use their own assistive technologies; Touch screen interfaces may also increase accessibility
