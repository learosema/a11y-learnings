# Blindness
Blindness is generally characterized as sightlessness or a loss of vision. While the term “blindness” is often used to define a total loss of vision, it may also refer to partial blindness, where sight may be extremely limited ([low vision](../low-vision) opens in a new window).

## Causes of Blindness
There are several causes of blindness, including (but not limited to):

- Diabetes
- Macular Degeneration
- Glaucoma
- Accidents or traumatic injuries to the eye
- Stroke
- Retinitis Pigmentosa

## Legal Definition of Blindness

In the United States, there is a legal definition of blindness that is used solely to determine eligibility and participation in various programs. These programs may include schooling, disability benefits, vocational programs, assistive device programs, and tax exemption programs. The definition is not intended to provide a functional definition of low vision, meaning it does not disclose what a person can or cannot see.

According to the U.S. definition of blindness, a person who has a visual acuity of 20/200 with corrective lenses or who has a field of vision (what can be seen in front of the person) that is 20 degrees in the eye that has the best vision is considered to be legally blind.

## Experiences Using the Web

When I tell people that my job is to help make the web more accessible to people with disabilities, it's always interesting to witness their reactions. Often their first impulse is to say something like, "Wow, that's cool." Then, almost as immediately, they often ask, "What kind of disabilities are you talking about?" I tell them that the main categories are visual disabilities, including blindness, low vision, and color blindness, auditory disabilities, motor disabilities, cognitive disabilities, and seizure disorders. Sometimes before I get a chance to finish my list of disability types, though, people will stop me and ask, "Wait, how does a blind person use the web?" That usually marks the beginning of an interesting discussion that allows people to think in new ways that they never thought of before.

So, how does a blind person use the web? The answer is that they use a software program called a screen reader.

## Screen Readers

Screen readers convert the text on the web page into spoken words. Blind people listen to web pages. In the video below, Rakesh Babu—an Assistant Professor in the School of Information Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee—talks about what it is like to use a screen reader, along with some of the challenges that web sites can present when they aren't designed with accessibility in mind.

Note: Experienced screen reader users often turn up the speed on their screen readers, so if you have a hard time understanding the screen reader as they use it, that's why. The default speed for screen readers is much slower, at a more conversational pace.

- [Rakesh] As I was growing up and I began to lose my sight, the whole world was shut, because I couldn’t see anything.

(screen reader speaking)

I just heard it say “Google.” That means I am on my home page. Screen readers are these software that are designed to translate text into speech.

(screen reader speaking)

So, and that’s the primary way or other technology that helps blind people interact with the web and the computers. And this seems like there’s a calendar here, (laughs) but that’s just my guesswork. With a little bit of understanding and compassion, designers can build technologies that are more blind-friendly. People like me who can’t see can, in fact, contribute, participate effectively in every aspect of life, you know, just as other people do.
