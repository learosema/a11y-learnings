# Auditory Disabilities

Auditory disabilities involve hearing impairment, hearing loss, and deafness. People who have hearing impairment or hearing loss have diminished hearing and may have difficulty understanding speech and distinguishing foreground noise from background noise. Depending on the condition, some people may use hearing aids as an assistive technology or may rely on lip reading to communicate with others. For those who have total loss of hearing, augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) such as sign language or communication boards are used to communicate with others.

Another disability in this category is Central Auditory Processing Disorder (ADP), which results in difficulty with processing sounds or speech. A person with this disorder doesn’t have any measurable hearing loss, but instead there are challenges with interpreting, organizing, or analyzing what they hear. ADP may be confused with other disorders, such as ADHD, learning disabilities, or emotional delays. The exact causes of ADP aren't known, but it may be related to illness such as meningitis or nervous system disorders, premature birth or low weight, head injury, or genetics.

## Causes of Auditory Disabilities

There are several causes of hearing loss and deafness. These causes may include genetics, premature birth, infections/illnesses, ear trauma, exposure to loud noises, and aging, to name a few.

## Deafness versus Deaf Culture

The terms "deaf" with a lowercase letter "d" and "Deaf" with an uppercase letter "D" have two separate meanings. The lowercase "deaf" term refers to the condition of deafness, the partial or total hearing loss a person experiences from a medical perspective. The uppercase usage of "Deaf" refers to Deaf Culture or Deaf Community. Deaf culture or Deaf Community focuses on the beliefs, cultural norms, values, and experiences shared between a group or groups of people who are deaf. The capitalization of the term "Deaf" is used to reference a member of the Deaf Community.

The capitalization of the term used to identify culture and community was a result of the way those who can hear view deafness versus how deafness is viewed by those who experience deafness. People who can hear have often interpreted deafness as a medical condition, and view hearing loss as an actual physical loss of something (see medical model of disability opens in a new window). Those in the Deaf Community view deafness from a cultural perspective, using sign language to communicate and belonging to a specific culture. Deafness is not viewed as a loss by those in the Deaf Community. Those who identify with Deaf Culture view deafness using the social identity or cultural affiliation opens in a new window model of disability.

## Experiences Using the Web
Most of the web is accessible to people with auditory disabilities, because most of the web is presented in a visual or text format. With the convergence of technologies, though, more and more video, audio, and multimedia content is making its way to the internet. Movies are available online, as well as television shows, news programs, video blogs, and other rich content.

## Web Accessibility for Deafness

The concern with deafness is the accessibility of audio, in either audio-only formats, or audio combined with video, as is often the case. For pre-recorded audio-only files, the best solution is usually a transcript of the audio. The transcript should include all of the narration, dialog, and other important sounds, such as applause, crashes, music, etc.

Video files usually contain audio synchronized with video itself. Time-dependent audio and video require captions. A transcript is not sufficient, because without synchronized captions, viewers can't know exactly where the transcript lines up with the video.

## Provide Synchronized Video Captions Plus a Transcript

Below is an example of a video with synchronized captions. If they are not automatically turned on for you, select the play button, then select the CC button ("CC" stands for "closed captions") on the bottom left side of the video.

- [Jeff, skiing guide] Turn a left, turn a right. Turn a left, turn a right. Turn a left, turn a right.

- [Erik Weihenmayer, blind skier] I think in a blind person’s daily life, they don’t get speed, and that’s what I think the most exciting part of skiing is when you’re blind, is that you’re really moving fast. When you’re blind, you’re reacting to what you’re feeling under your feet, so you’re literally reacting instantaneously. It’s very exciting or terrifying, depending on how you look at life.

(guitar music, Jeff and Erik skiing down the hill)

- [Jeff] Turn a left, turn a right. Turn a left, turn a right.

- [Erik] In only eight, simple words, Jeff tells me everything I need to know on the slope. With each syllable, there’s no guesswork. I know exactly where to be.

(guitar music)

- [Jeff] Go towards me here. Back to the right, to check your speed, and here we go. We’re gonna start to ski to the left. Turn a left.

- [Erik] To become a good blind skier, it takes an investment. You have to have a good guide who you really trust, and you have to build that relationship.

(guitar and vocal music)

- [Jeff] I have to make sure that somebody up the hill is not running out of control, isn’t gonna take, you know, Erik out or myself out. I cannot mess up. (calling out while skiing) Turn and stop.

- [Erik] You can still, in bumps, get, just get completely hammered every now and then, you know? So, it’s just part of the, I guess, fun. (laughs) (Erik hits a snow bank and falls) Whoa! I really did hit something there.

- [Jeff] Turn a right. Turn a left. (guitar music)

A transcript is important too. Transcripts allow users to go through the content at their own pace and can be especially helpful for people who cannot read quickly. Transcripts are also the only way that a person who is both deaf and blind can access video or audio content at all, because neither the video nor the audio is directly accessible to someone who is deaf and blind. Only digital text is accessible, because it can be converted into braille by a screen reader.
