# Cognitive Disabilities

By far the most common type of disability is cognitive disabilities. Cognitive disabilities can arise as a result of congenital conditions that are with an individual from birth, or developmental conditions that are with a person from a young age. They can also result from traumatic injury, infections, chemical imbalances, or other conditions later in life.

There is no one way to describe cognitive disabilities. There are so many different kinds, and so many variations within those kinds. A specific individual may experience a deficit in only one area, rather than all of them. Still, there are some trends or categories worth listing, not because they apply to everyone, but because they are part of the cognitive disability spectrum.

Web Accessibility for Cognitive Disabilities
Limited Comprehension
Most people with cognitive disabilities experience limited comprehension of one kind or another. They may not be able to understand complex ideas. They may have difficulty with metaphors or abstract language. They may not understand some kinds of slang or idiomatic expressions. Some people with cognitive disabilities have exceptionally high cognitive functions in one area—the ability to remember numbers or conversations—but low cognitive functions in other areas, such as social skills or emotional awareness.

Low Tolerance for Cognitive Overload
Some people with cognitive disabilities easily become frustrated or upset when they sense difficult situations, or when there are too many things in their environment happening at the same time. They cannot handle the complexity of the moment. They need things to be simple and straightforward. Too many choices can cause them to freeze, and they may be emotionally unable to change their state of mind until later, long after the moment has passed.

Limited Problem-Solving Skills
When presented with a problem to solve, some people with cognitive disabilities may simply be unable to solve it, so they may not even attempt to solve it. If a website requires users to type in text in a CAPTCHA (like the CAPTCHA shown in the screen shot below), for instance, they not be able to process what kind of action is required.

If they type an incorrect response and get an error message, they may not be able to figure out why they got the error message, or how to solve the problem.

## Short Term Memory Loss

Some people with cognitive disabilities have a hard time remembering things from one moment to the next. Their brains don't allow them to focus on new information, so they don't retain it in the short term. Long web processes—such as online purchasing procedures, account sign-up procedures, or setting preferences—can cause users to forget what they were doing, or to lose track of information that they may need to remember from one step to the next.

## Attention Deficit

Some users experience attention deficits, making it hard for them to focus on the task at hand. They may get lost in their own thoughts, or they may find online advertisements too alluring, causing them to forget why they went to the website in the first place.
