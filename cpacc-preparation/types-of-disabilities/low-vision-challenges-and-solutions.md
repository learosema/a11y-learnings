# Challenges & Solutions for People with Low Vision

## Learning Goals

The CPACC exam will ask you questions that show you know how to:

1. Identify accessibility challenges that people who have low vision experience.
2. Match the challenges with appropriate:
  Assistive technologies (products or items that people can use)
  Adaptive strategies (methods to work around or avoid the challenges)

## Low Vision: Examples of Challenges and Solutions

### General

#### Challenge: Small text can be hard to read.

- Screen magnifiers can enlarge the items on the screen to make them easier to read.
- Utilities to enhance contrast, change colors, or alter other aspects of visual appearance can improve legibility.
- Screen readers can supplement screen magnifiers by reading interfaces and content out loud to users through synthesized speech, but only if the digital information has been designed to be accessible.
- Self-voicing interfaces (on ATMs, kiosks, transportation systems, etc.) and applications can communicate to users without the need for a screen reader, but these are appropriate mostly for broadcasting information, because they usually do not interact with the interface or content as screen readers do.
- Alternative large print versions of small print text can make printed materials easier to read.
- Alternative digital versions (web, mobile applications, etc.) of printed materials can give users the ability to read the materials using their own assistive technologies.

#### Low contrast text can be hard to read.

- Software or hardware options can enhance the contrast of digital text.
- Interface designers and content creators can choose color combinations with high enough contrast to easily read
