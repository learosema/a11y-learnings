## Seizure Disorders: Challenges and Solutions

### Challenges in ICT and in general

#### Sensitivity to flashing lights, blinking, and flickering stimuli	

- Avoid creating animations, videos, and other graphics, that have flashing or strobe-like effects whenever possible
- If flashing content must be used, flashing should not last for more than three (3) seconds
- Tools that may be helpful are flicker-free monitors, monitor glare guards, and non-glare glasses.
