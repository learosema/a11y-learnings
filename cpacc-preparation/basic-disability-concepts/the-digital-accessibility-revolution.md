# The Digital Accessibility Revolution

Have you ever described a person who uses a wheelchair as "wheelchair-bound?" When you use this phrase, the underlying assumption, whether you realize it or not, is that the wheelchair is getting in the way of the person's ability to do things. It's as if the wheelchair is to blame for the limitations of the person. Think about that for a moment. Why would anyone "bind" or confine themselves to a chair if the chair was going to get in the way of everything? 

People don't use wheelchairs to reduce their mobility. They use wheelchairs to increase and enhance their mobility. A person would be confined to limited mobility without the wheelchair. The wheelchair is not the problem for mobility. Wheelchairs are an important part of the solution to mobility. A person who uses a wheelchair is not "wheelchair-bound." The person is very much "wheelchair-enabled."

No, this isn't just a twist of the phrase to make it more politically-correct. It is an important and accurate distinction.

## The Web is Part of the Solution, Not the Source of the Problem

A similar type of backwards thinking sometimes happens when web developers first learn about the need to make web sites accessible to people with disabilities.

Web developers begin to think of the web as the problem (like thinking of wheelchairs as the problem), when in reality the web is an important part of the solution, along with other digital technologies. Here are a couple of examples of ways in which the web creates abilities.

## The Web Enables Unprecedented Access to Information for the Blind

With the advent of the web, blind people can now go to their own computer, turn on their screen reader, and listen to the screen reader read the daily news, their favorite blog entries, social media posts, and other online source of information. 

Of course, their screen readers can read only the information that has been designed for accessibility, but even if we take that important caveat into account, this is the first time in the history of the world that blind people have had this much freedom and independence to access information on their own.

Think back as recently as a couple of decades ago. How did blind people access the Washington Post, or the New York Times, or any other newspaper?

The answer is that they did not. They could not, at least not independently. A friend or family member could read the newspaper to them, but there was no way for blind people to access the information on their own, without help. 

In any case, not all blind people had easy access to patient friends or family who would be willing to dedicate so much time to help by reading the news out loud. A blind person with access to money could pay an assistant to read the newspapers, but many blind people could not afford to have another person always on hand to act as their eyes.

Even if a blind person was lucky enough to have such an assistant, the blind person was still dependent, unable to perform these tasks without help. Don't underestimate the power and importance of independence. It can make all the difference between living a "normal" independent life and living a life of limited freedom and independence.

## The Web Enables Unprecedented Access to Commerce for People with Mobility Impairments

Now imagine that you have quadriplegia. You are unable to move your legs, and you have only limited movement in your arms, but you have movement in your neck and head, so you are able to use a mouth stick to type on your keyboard and use a trackball mouse. You use a motorized wheelchair for mobility, which, as discussed previously, is a fantastic enabling device, but some things are still inconvenient. If you wanted to go shopping at the mall, what process would you need to go through?

To begin with, you would need to have an assistant help you get ready to go outside, which can be quite an undertaking. The assistant would need to bathe you, assist you in using the toilet, or in emptying your on-board hygiene containers, help you get dressed, put you back into your chair, and strap you in.

Most likely, this assistant would also need to come with you to help with purchase transactions, carry the purchases or load them onto the chair, etc. Some shopping trips could be done alone, as long as the people in the stores are willing to help go through your wallet to pull out the appropriate amount of money or the right credit card.

But before making any purchases, you have to get from your home to the mall somehow. If you are lucky enough to live in a good public transit district, you would board the bus and wait patiently while the bus driver strapped your wheelchair into place for safety during the bus ride. 

The other passengers on the bus would also have to wait during this process, and some of them might not be as patient or understanding about it as you would like. At the end of the bus ride (hopefully there are no transfers!), you and the other passengers would wait while the driver unstrapped the wheelchair and lowered the lift to allow the wheelchair to exit the bus.

Or, if you are not lucky enough to live in a good public transportation district, you would board your own specially-designed wheelchair-accessible van, with the help of an assistant.

Once you got to the mall, you might be met with steps or physical barriers of other kinds. You might not find friendly salespeople willing to take out your wallet and count your money accurately. You might need to use the restroom, which is a major undertaking for you and your assistant, if the bathroom is even wheelchair accessible.

And then, when you're done, you've got to do all of this all over again, but in reverse to get back home. Even if the entire process is accessible, it's not easy, and it's time-consuming.

But there is a faster, more convenient way: shop on the internet.

A person with quadriplegia can stay home and shop from the convenience of the wheelchair without having to go through all of the cumbersome steps necessary to prepare to appear in public, board the bus, and deal with all of the inconveniences that accompany a trip to the mall in a wheelchair.
