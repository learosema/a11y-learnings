# Biopsychosocial Model

The biopsychosocial model recognizes that disability is a complex and multi-faceted concept and incorporates the perspectives of the medical and social models. This includes the biological, individual, and social aspects of disability.

This model is the basis for the [International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF)](https://www.who.int/standards/classifications/international-classification-of-functioning-disability-and-health), a publication by the World Health Organization in 2002.
