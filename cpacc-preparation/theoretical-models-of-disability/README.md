# Theoretical Models of Disability

## Definitions and Perceptions Matter

What does "disability" mean to you? Do you think of disabilities in terms of non-functional body parts? Do you think of disabling conditions in the built environment, or in our culture, or in political systems? Are disabilities normal? Should we pity people with disabilities?

Should we be careful how we define disabilities so that people don't take unfair advantage of government welfare payments to people with disabilities? Are people with disabilities "inspirational" when they learn to work around their disabilities, or when they excel at their jobs, or in sports, or in life?

The assumptions we make about people with disabilities have a profound impact on the lives of people with disabilities. Our assumptions inform government policies, work opportunities, and social acceptance (or stigmas) for people with disabilities.

It's important to examine our assumptions about disabilities so that we don't accidentally create problems and barriers for people with disabilities. This section about the theoretical models of disabilities is designed to help us examine our assumptions.

## Learning Goals of this Section

For the theoretical models of disability, you should be able to:

1. Characterize and differentiate between theoretical models of disability, including the strengths and weaknesses of their underlying assumptions
2. Identify the names, terminology, and basic concepts of prominent theoretical models of disability.
3. Compare and contrast the underlying assumptions of the different models.
4. Compare the implications of each model on public and personal perceptions of disability.
5. Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each model.
6. Demonstrate an understanding of which models align most closely with the principles of accessibility and universal design.
7. Demonstrate an understanding of ways in which various models may overlap or complement each other.
8. Apply the models to example scenarios in the lives of people with disabilities.
