# Charity model

The 'charity model' of disability sees people with disability as in need of 'help', unable to do things for themselves. While many charities offer vital support, much traditional fundraising emphasised the helplessness of people with disability and risked undermining their autonomy, independence and rights.

Where the Medical Model sees medical professionals as experts in disability, the Charity Model sees non-disabled people as the saviours of disability. Disability is not only something that should be cured, but something that is tragic.

It therefore creates a view of disabled people’s lives as tragic and pitiable.

According to the Charity model, people may view persons with disabilities as not having the capacity
to live independently or live together with other people without disabilities, with the implication
that they must be ‘cared for’ in separate facilities from the rest of the community and that they are
unable to make their own decisions.

## Weaknesses

- Like in the medical model, the disability is modeled as the problem
- Like in the medical model, it is a pathologizing and stigmatizing view on disabilities
- Treats the disabled person as a tragedy and pityable
- Focuses on sympathy but not on empowerment
- It's actually disempowering, devalues disabled people's lives as inferior
- Encourages dependencies rather than helping disabled people to become more independant
- Non-disabled people decide whom of the disabled people receive sympathy or help
- It doesn't help disabled people
- the charity model is also all about non-disabled-people who are so nice to help disabled people

## Plusses (are there actually any?)

- Non-disabled people may (or may not) develop empathy for disabled people
- May (or may not) result in help as a result of charity campaigns for some disabled people
