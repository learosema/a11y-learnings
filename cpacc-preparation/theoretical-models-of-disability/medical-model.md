# Medical Model

The medical model defines disability in terms of biological impairments. Disability is viewed as a problem that is caused by medically-diagnosed genetic disorders, disease, trauma, or other health conditions. Disability is treated as a biological problem that diminishes quality of life and needs to be treated with professional medical care.

There are arrows pointing toward the people in the circle. The arrows are labeled as social workers, therapists, specialists, physicians, different schools, different transportation, different house designs, back entrance to buildings, less desirable jobs, fewer opportunities, and lower expectations.](medicalModelSmaller.png)

The legal definition of disabilities often relies on the assumptions of the medical model. A person is legally designated as "disabled" if the person meets a certain threshold of biological impairment. 

This legal/medical definition is often used as a way to decide whether a person should receive certain government financial benefits, or whether an employer is required to provide disability accommodations to the person in the workplace, or whether a student is eligible for disability accommodations at school or in the university.

## Strengths of the Medical Model

The medical model explicitly acknowledges that there is a biological condition that places an individual at a disadvantage compared to the majority of the population. In other words, it states an obvious point about the biological reality of disabilities.

In a clinical medical setting, a clearly-defined set of biological criteria to diagnose a person's condition helps medical professionals make important decisions in terms of treatment. Similarly, when deciding who should receive government assistance, a clearly-defined set of criteria helps inform those decisions.

## Weaknesses of the Medical Model

There are many problems with the medical model, and the medical model is frequently criticized by disability advocates.

First, the medical model focuses exclusively on the biology of the person, which means that it overlooks the impact of the design decisions in our social environment. For example, while it is true that a person who cannot use her legs has a true biological limitation associated with her legs, it is not her fault that she can't enter a building if all entrances to the buildings have stairs with no ramps or elevators.

In that case, there is a fundamental problem with the building's design. The designers did not take into account the diversity of the human condition when designing the entrance to the building.

Second, the medical model assigns disability as a characteristic of an individual person, essentially labeling and stigmatizing the person as different and "less than" the rest of the population. There is a psychological impact to this kind of distinction.

Third, when medical definitions are used as a way to determine who is "worthy" of certain benefits, people who do not fit within the clearly-defined definitions may be denied benefits that they need. There is a danger that the definitions might be too narrow and too exclusive for some people with disabilities.

Fourth, if individuals are required to prove that they have a qualifying disability according to some pre-defined list of medical conditions, this requirement adds a level of inconvenient bureaucracy to their lives. Having to prove one's disability over and over is time consuming and can be dehumanizing.
