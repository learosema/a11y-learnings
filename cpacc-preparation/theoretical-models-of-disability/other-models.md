# Other Models

## Affirmation Model

The affirmation model is similar to the [social identity or cultural affiliation model](social-identity-or-cultural-affiliation-model.md), in that it encourages people with disabilities to affirm their identity, and to feel comfortable in their own skin, celebrating everything about their physical identity, including their disabilities.

See [Towards an Affirmation Model of Disability](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09687590050058189), by John Swain and Sally French, Disability and Society, Volume 15, Issue 4 (2000)

## Sociopolitical Model

The sociopolitical model is more of an activist model that emphasizes the need for human rights for people with disabilities.

## Religious/Moral Model

One interpretation of the religious/moral model assumes that disabilities are given to people as a punishment for actions of either the individual herself or of her parents or others who have brought this condition upon her. Or, if a disability is not seen as a punishment, it may be regarded as a condition given by God to teach a lesson or to test the person.

## Expert or Professional Model

The expert or professional model is a variation of the [medical model](medical-model.md), in which disabilities are meant to be treated and managed by people with expertise and credentials.

See [Definitions of Models of Disability](http://www.disabled-world.com/definitions/disability-models.php)

## Rehabilitation Model

The rehabilitation model is also a variation of the [medical model](medical-model.md), with an emphasis on therapy or rehabilitation for the person with a disability to improve the person's ability to function and compensate for the disability.
