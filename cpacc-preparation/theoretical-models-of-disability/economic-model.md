# Economic Model

The economic model views disabilities from the perspective of the economic impact of the disability on individuals, employers, the state, and welfare programs.

This model recognizes that disabilities impact peopleâ€™s ability to work, which has various implications. For example, a person with a disability may earn less money and have a higher cost for necessary assistance (such as a care provider). An employer might have lower profit margins, and the state might have increased cost in terms of welfare programs.

While this model does well to recognize that bodily limitations impact work, it may also create a sense of stigma. In other words, if a group of people is legally defined as needing assistance such as disability payments, they may be negatively viewed as being "needy" members of society. 

We can see how in this way, the economic model is closely related to the charity model. In addition, many people have disabilities that significantly impact their ability to work, but they do not meet the legal definition of having a disability and therefore do not qualify for various assistance programs.
