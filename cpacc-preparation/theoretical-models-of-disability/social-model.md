# Social Model

The social model of disability is a direct response to the medical model. Rather than place the definition of "disability" entirely on the person with a disability, the social model points out that society creates disabling conditions. To a large extent, "disability" is an avoidable condition caused by poor design.

There are arrows pointing outward from the globe, with labels saying public planners, product designers, architects, web designers, integrated schools, accessible transportation, accessible houses, equal access to buildings, choice of jobs, opportunities for all, higher expectations.](socialModelSmaller.png)

The social model doesn't deny that there is a biological or medical component to disability. It merely points out that more inclusive designs can remove the barriers that people with disabilities face in their everyday lives. The social model emphasizes the human rights of people with disabilities to participate in society in meaningful ways.

The social model of disability provides a meaningful context for accessibility professionals. People who make accessible web sites, buildings, consumer products, and transportation systems are doing their part to ensure that the environments we create are enabling and not disabling for people with different physical abilities.

## A Thought Experiment: A Town of All Wheelchair Users

### Video transcript

<figure>
Imagine a town full of physically impaired people, all wheelchair users. They run everything. There aren't any able-bodied people, so, naturally, when they built the town, the community decided it was pointless to have ceilings 10-foot high and doors 7-foot high, so the ceilings were built at 7 foot the doors at 5 foot. In every way, they designed the place the way they wanted it.

One day, a few able-bodied people come to stay. One of the first things they notice is the height of the doors. And the reason they notice is because they keep hitting their heads. They come to stand out by the bruises they carry on their foreheads. Soon, doctors, psychiatrists, and social workers all become involved. Committees are formed. Many people are worried about what becomes known as "the problem of the able-bodied." Throughout the town there is a growth of real concern.

Specially toughened helmets are handed out free to the able-bodied, to be worn at all times. Braces are designed, which give support and relief while keeping the able-bodied wearer bent to normal height. Various groups of compassionate wheelchair users get together and form registered charities. Every quarter, they have a collection day. Upturned helmets are left in pubs and shops for people to drop their small change into. There is talk of founding special homes.

But then, one day, it dawns on the able-bodied that there is nothing actually wrong with them, just that society excludes them.

## Strengths of the Social Model

The social model empowers people with disabilities by removing the stigma often associated with physical impairments. The expectation is that society will create inclusive environments, and not that people with disabilities need to accept a lower quality of life simply because their bodies do not conform to "normal" expectations.

The social model also empowers designers of physical and virtual environments to think broadly about usability for all kinds of humans. Inclusive designs sometimes require more creative thinking, but this can be a benefit, because the resulting designs are often better for everyone, not just for people with disabilities.

The big picture with the social model is that society can be more welcoming, more just, with a higher quality of life for all, if we make the effort to design with accessibility in mind.

## Weaknesses of the Social Model

Some disability advocates have argued that, despite the positive impact of the social model to combat the narrowly-focused and exclusive nature of the medical model, the social model can de-emphasize the physical reality of a disability too much.

They argue that a person's disability can be an important part of one's identity, and it shouldn't be minimized to the point that people are afraid to talk about it.

Accepting and "owning" one's disability can be very healthy from an emotional and psychological perspective. The [social identity model](social-identity-or-cultural-affiliation-model.md) of disability is one answer to this criticism.
