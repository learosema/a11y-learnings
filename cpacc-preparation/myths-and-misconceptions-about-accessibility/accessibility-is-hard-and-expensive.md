# Myth: Accessibility is hard and expensive

## Truth: The Cost of Accessibility is Reasonable when Compared to the Cost of the Alternatives

### Maintaining an accessible system is cost effective

Creating an accessible system does cost money, but failing to create an accessible system can turn out to be even more expensive in the end.

In contrast to the previous myth, some people think that accessibility is too much of a burden, so they avoid the responsibility and choose to take their chances with legal liability.

There is some truth to this objection if you're trying to retrofit an existing web site with lots of accessibility problems. At that point it's too late to reap the benefits of good planning. You may have to start over, and starting over is certainly expensive.

If you start with accessibility in mind, though, you'll be able to incorporate accessible design into every step of the process, and soon it will become second nature.

There will always be some cost associated with accessibility. It takes time to plan for it. It takes time to add accessibility features to the markup. It takes time to add accessibility features during the development phase of scripts and widgets. All of this time costs money. 

But when compared to the cost of trying to retrofit for accessibility, or compared to the cost of trying to defend a lawsuit against your inaccessible web site, the costs are not as bad as they may seem at first.

### Lawsuits are expensive

Avoiding accessibility for fear of the cost can lead to another kind of cost: the cost of legal litigation. If your company is served a lawsuit, the cost of fighting can be extraordinarily high, especially if the lawsuit goes to court, and most especially if the court rules against you.

The court may demand the payment of fines, damages, and/or legal costs. Even if the legal action does not go to court, just the act of engaging the lawyers of both sides can be expensive.

### Negative publicity is expensive

Having your company's name in the news for failing to meet the needs of people with disabilities is the kind of publicity that is best to avoid. It can be even worse if your company decides to fight against making things accessible.

Being known as a company that intentionally discriminates against people with disabilities isn't exactly the best way to build good will among clients, and among people with disabilities in particular. Negative publicity can spread quickly and can undermine other positive things that the company may be doing.
