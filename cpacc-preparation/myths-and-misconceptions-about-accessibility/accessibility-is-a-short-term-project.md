# Myth: Accessibility is a short-term project

## Truth: Accessibility is an ongoing design requirement

Accessibility is not going away. As long as there are people, there will be a need for accessible design. There will always be people with disabilities, because it turns out that is a normal part of the human experience.

Future medical advances and social advances (e.g. fewer wars, less poverty, etc.) will likely decrease the number of people with disabilities, but we will never reach a point of zero disabilities, because there are always situations in which a person might have an injury, a temporary disability, or a temporary circumstance that prevents certain types of actions or sensory experiences.

You can compare accessibility to other focus areas like security or privacy. Those needs will never disappear or be phased out. They are ongoing requirements in all stages of development and QA.

## Accessibility must be embedded into the process

Accessibility needs to be part of the process from start to finish, including:

- Business requirements
- Design requirements
- QA requirements and test cases
- Training of new employees
- Ongoing training and professional development for current employees
- Software to detect accessibility flaws
- The company culture must commit to accessibility

Having a vision and top-level buy-in, where explicit support from the CEO and other leaders within the company is expressed, is very helpful in setting accessibility expectations within a company. Without visionary leadership, a companyâ€™s efforts will be haphazard at best.

In the absence of this kind of leadership, there may be a few people or departments within the company that may commit to accessibility, but an incomplete approach will always produce incomplete results. The organization is only as strong as the weakest link in the chain.

## Commit resources and full-time jobs to accessibility

A successful accessibility program is led by people whose full-time job is to coordinate accessibility efforts. Hire people who specialize in accessibility, and give them enough authority within the company to make a real difference. Let them do what is necessary to hold the company accountable for producing accessible results.

Ensure there are people with strong technical knowledge of accessibility within the company. Sometimes it makes sense to split the roles of accessibility program management on the one hand and accessibility technical expertise on the other hand. That way, people with strong management skills can focusing on managing, and people with strong technical skills can focus on providing the subject matter expertise.

## Hiring people with disabilities can be immensely helpful

Working together on a daily basis with people with diverse abilities and disabilities is one of the most powerful ways to ensure that accessibility is at the forefront of the design process. Having colleagues with disabilities makes it real. It's much easier to understand accessibility when you see the effect directly on people you know and interact with.

Hiring people with disabilities requires a concerted effort in the HR process. Keep in mind that people with disabilities face numerous obstacles throughout their lives, so it is easy to focus on perceived weaknesses in their qualifications. Those weaknesses may be real, but may not be their fault.

Systematic discrimination plays a key role in suppressing the potential of people with disabilities. Be willing to commit to inclusive hiring practices as a long-term strategy.
