# Myth: Accessibility should be the last step

## Truth: Designing for Accessibility is Much Easier (and results in a better design) than Retrofitting for Accessibility

Oftentimes accessibility is one of the last things that organizations plan for in their web projects. Some people think that accessibility is easy and trivial enough that it can wait until the last minute of the development process after all of the other work is done.

They assume that bolting on accessibility to a finished product is good enough. There are some big problems with this mindset:

### A last-minute bolted-on approach usually results in a bad design, and a bad user experience.

It might be possible to create a last-minute solution that is technically functional (sort of)—or maybe even technically compliant with the guidelines—but to make it actually a good user experience, you probably have to start over.

### Adding accessibility at the end can be difficult. 

Imagine trying to add electrical wiring and plumbing to a building after the building is finished, and all of the interior design is in place. Where would you even begin? You're going to have to tear apart the walls and force things to fit where they weren't designed to fit. You might be able to do it, but you wouldn't enjoy it, and it would take a lot of time and effort to come up with something that is barely acceptable. You might be better off starting over.

### Accessibility might never get done at all. 

If an organization discovers that the accessibility work is too hard (because they failed to plan properly at the beginning), they may decide to skip the effort altogether and release a web site that is badly flawed. Business goals often trump accessibility goals in those situations, and people with disabilities end up on the losing end.

### The cycle is self-perpetuating.

Until accessibility is taken into account in the concept and design stage, it is impossible to produce high quality accessible designs, because of the practical constraints of trying to retrofit a finished design when it's too late.
### A last-minute approach exposes systematic neglect.

Even if it is not intentional, failing to take into account the needs of people with disabilities shows that their needs are not a priority for an organization.

### Poor planning is a legal liability.

If an organization is constantly producing web designs that fail accessibility standards, the organization is constantly at legal risk for discriminating against people with disabilities, in violation of applicable laws.

## Conclusion

Design with accessibility in mind from the beginning. It takes a little bit of extra forethought and planning, but it saves you a lot of work down the road.
