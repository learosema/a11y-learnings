# Differences

It is often difficult to tell the difference between usability and accessibility because there are indeed similarities between the two. There are times, though, when issues are just usability issues and when issues are truly accessibility issues.

Usability issues tend to affect every user, both users with disabilities and users without disabilities. All users face some difficulty using a product or service. Accessibility issues occur when people with disabilities encounter difficulties using or accessing a product or service.](usabilityaccessibilitydifference.png)

There are also times when remediating accessibility issues may cause usability issues. For instance, if all images on a website are assigned very long text alternatives, the images may be accessible, but listening to long alternative text creates usability issues. 

There is a fine balance in ensuring that addressing accessibility issues does not cause usability issues and addressing usability issues does not create accessibility issues.

To help determine the differences between usability and accessibility in usability test reports, reports should highlight accessibility issues, detail which users with disabilities the issues affect, and state the specific accessibility standards the issues fail.
