# Universal Design for the Physical World

## Learning Goals of this Section
T
o demonstrate your understanding of universal design for the physical world, you should be able to:

1. Explain the concept of universal design for the physical world.
2. Name the seven principles of universal design.
3. Provide various examples of principles of universal design in the physical world.

Accessibility requires paying attention to our natural physical diversity and implementing good universal design choices.


## How Accessible is Our World?

In this section, we're going to take a close look at the accessibility of the built environment in which we live, and of common consumer products that many of us encounter on a regular basis. You may be surprised to see how unwelcoming our world can be to people with disabilities. There are a lot of inconveniences.

But guess what? We created those inconveniences.

We designed them.

## Our Designs Disable People

We built a world that caters to the young and fully-able-bodied. In part, this is because designers themselves tend to be young and fully-able-bodied. Our designers have created a world that assumes a certain kind of physical sameness and neglects our natural physical diversity.

Usually this neglect is unintentional. Designers aren't trying to be mean. They just tend to not think about the needs of people with disabilities because they aren't always aware of what those needs are.

## Universal Design in the Physical World

The physical world is all around us. We can immediately grasp the immediacy of the challenges. Some of the examples (like sidewalks, doors, drinking fountains, etc.) may not seem at first to be relevant to web accessibility, but trust us on this one: thinking about these types of situations will help you understand the real nature of the problem. Here's a list of the things we'll examine:
