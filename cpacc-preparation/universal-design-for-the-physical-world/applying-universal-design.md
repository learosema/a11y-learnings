# Applying Universal Design to Physical Spaces

## Example: Designing Spaces for People who are Deaf

Universal design involves building a number of possible accommodations into the physical environment that people may need to use a space effectively. Gallaudet University's approach to designing spaces for people who are deaf is one example of applying universal design in architecture. The university recognizes that those who are deaf need more physical space to talk while walking through physical spaces. Some of these design considerations include:

- Wide hallways
- Ramps instead of stairs
- Classroom seating organized in semi-circles so that everyone can see each other
- Public spaces that have:
  - Transparent or semi-transparent doorways and passageways
  - Mirrors to see behind and around to increase perception of the surroundings
  - Muted blue and green colors for furniture and interior design to contrast with skin tones

The video below further describes how Gallaudet University is enhancing physical spaces for people who are deaf.

  [Sound of subway announcements]

[Voiceover:] We live in a world built for people who hear.

[Voice coming through a cell phone:] Hello, can you hear me?

[Sounds of many different day-to-day activities]

[Voiceover:] But what would our man-made world look like and feel like if it were designed for those who don't hear? Gallaudet University in Washington, DC is a school for the Deaf and hard of hearing, and they are redesigning entire buildings based on the sensory experience of those who don't hear.

[Derrick Behm, from the Office of Campus Design and Planning, communicating through an Interpreter:] We've only just begun to challenge ourselves to examine how we could design entire buildings, entire campuses, or even cities, to be aligned with DeafSpace.

[Graphic:] Deaf Space: An approach to architecture and design that is primarily informed by the unique ways in which Deaf people perceive and inhabit space.

[Behm:] Deaf people as a culture have been marginalized largely. We've been, as a marginalized community, developing our own culture and that defines what kind of place we call home, how we claim and occupy space. And so we've begun to ask ourselves these questions and because of that, gotten a lot more creative, begun to think bigger about how we can find different ways to align our ways of being to our environment.

[Graphic:] Group Space

[Behm:] The classrooms are oriented in a semi-circle or U-shape so that classmates can continually visually connect with other classmates. So if you want to be involved in a discussion, everybody has a front row seat to seeing.

[Graphic:] Walkways

[Behm:] In a wider hallway, two people can walk in parallel signing with each other. But we do have specific distance parameters wherein we can observe the whole body and its signing. Hearing people, though, could disregard that kind of a distance requirement. They can be just next to each other, speaking to each other without that need for the visual field. Stairs also require a great deal more visual attention to your footing and so ramps reduce that. So if you are communicating with somebody while you're navigating a ramp, you can do so much more easily.

[Graphic:] Visual Range

[Behm:] Within DeafSpace, we have always relied on a heavily visible environment, because we are not getting information auditorily. So if you are sitting at the top of the terrace you can see all the way to the bottom of the terrace. It's one distinct place that can be unified or have three distinct areas.

[Graphic:] Color & Light

[Behm:] Color and lighting are highly aligned to communication access. Blues and greens will usually contrast with most skin tones enough to reduce eye strain. You may want to have more diffused lighting. A lot of the lighting here is directional so that it can be aligned.

[Graphic:] Reflection

[Behm:] There are mirrors present to allow somebody to know and have a sense of what's happening behind them. Through the use of that reflection, they can know if somebody is nearing them behind them or if somebody taps them. They look up and that reflective space lets them know who's there.

[Graphic:] Transparency

[Behm:] Transparency of, say, doorways, so that when a person is in an office, they can either have a transparent doorway or passageway or one thatâ€™s opaqued, so that I can see lighting, and shadow, and movement and know somebody is at the door, but not clearly see who's there.

[Behm:] Very often, people refer to "hearing loss" as an example, which negatively frames the whole approach from the outset. But let's imagine the Deaf baby who has never heard and yet is still described as experiencing "hearing loss." And instead we propose a different framing: that of "Deaf gain." What is it that we gain by the experience of being or becoming Deaf?

[Behm:] DeafSpace, I believe is born of the idea that we have something to offer the world, that being Deaf confers some very interesting perspectives on life.
