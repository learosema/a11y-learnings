# Universal Design Principles

## Background

In 1997, a group of architects led by Ronald Mace at North Carolina State University called into question approaches to designing buildings, products, and environments. Mace and his group of architects realized that individuals are diverse and design of physical environments and products should be adaptable to individuals' needs. Together, the architects concluded that physical spaces and products should be "universal".

## The Seven Principles of Universal Design

Realizing that spaces and products should be designed for universal use, the group of architects developed seven principles to guide those working in the field in universal design. Though these seven principles were intended to be applied to architectural and industrial design, it will be evident throughout this course that these principles have been a point of reference to applying universal design to other areas such as education and web design.

## Principle One: Equitable Use

The design of the product or environment should be useful and marketable to everyone regardless of his or her abilities. If possible, everyone should be able to use the environment or product in the same manner. If identical uses are not provided, then equivalent options should be provided.

## Principle Two: Flexibility in Use

The design of the product or environment should provide people with a variety of options for use of its features. The environment or product should be adaptable to an individual's preferences and abilities.

## Principle Three: Simple and Intuitive Use

The purpose of the product or environment's features should be easy to understand. A person's background, language, or experience should not hinder his or her understanding of how to use the product or navigate the environment.

## Principle Four: Perceptible Information

Information about the product or environment's design should be communicated effectively and should be perceivable to everyone. A person's sensory abilities should not hinder him or her from receiving information. Information should be presented in different formats to increase effective communication to individuals with diverse abilities.

## Principle Five: Tolerance for Error

The design of the product or environment should reduce the chances of accidents or hazards from occurring. The design should also anticipate any unintentional actions that may occur during use.

## Principle Six: Low Physical Effort

The design of the product or environment should require little to no physical effort to use. A person should be able to use the product or navigate the environment comfortably without feeling fatigued during use or after use.

## Principle Seven: Size and Space for Approach and Use

Sufficient space should be provided in the design so that it allows anyone to use the design features regardless of physical build or physical abilities.
