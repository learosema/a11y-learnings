# Bathrooms

Everybody needs to go to the bathroom. Maybe not at this exact moment, but at some point you're going to need to go to the bathroom, right? Everybody does.

It's one of the most basic aspects about being alive. If all bathrooms were inaccessible to you, you'd really be hating life, wouldn't you? Well, if you're a person with quadriplegia, or even with paraplegia with use of the hands, you may find that far too many of the bathrooms in this world are inaccessible to wheelchairs. And that's a very uncomfortable discovery.

How long can you hold it in?

## What makes a bathroom inaccessible? The list is pretty long. Here are a few of the main ones:

- tight corners that make wheelchair navigation difficult or impossible
- sinks that don't allow wheelchair access underneath
- faucets that require the use of hands, especially if they require a good grip
- toilets that are too high or too low to slide over from a wheelchair
- bathroom stalls with no room for a wheelchair
- bathroom stalls without handgrips to assist in sliding onto the toilet
- toilet paper and paper towel dispensers that are placed too high or too low, or with obstacles in the way
- toilet paper or paper towel dispensers that require a strong grip

## Universal Design of Bathrooms and Fixtures

When done right, a single bathroom can serve the needs of people of different levels of ability and disability. Below is an image of a bathroom with lots of room for a wheelchair, plus bars on the wall to allow a person to grip while transitioning out of the wheelchair onto the toilet.

Here is a sink designed to allow wheelchair access underneath, as well as allow for stability by letting users grip the bars on the sides.

A hands-free faucet allows people to wash their hands without having to grip the faucet handles or levers.

## Bathroom Labels

Blind people can't see the labels on the doors. What happens if they walk into the bathroom the were not intending?

Yeah, that's a problem. How can we fix it? One way would be to provide unisex bathrooms. That way it wouldn't matter which bathroom they use.

Of course, that only really works in single-user bathrooms, unless we suddenly change our social expectations around bathrooms, which isn't likely to happen any time soon. (Lea says: unisex multi-user bathrooms work! They are quite common in trans-inclusive 
spaces and even in some schools by now)

In multi-user bathrooms, the main solution is to use braille on the signs.

We're still faced with the limitation that not all blind people can read braille, but this at least gets us closer. It would help if the icons of the woman and the man and the letters were also raised into tactile shapes, to make it easier to distinguish between the two labels for those who don't read braille.
