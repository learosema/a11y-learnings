# Communication Management

## General Awareness

The entire team needs to be aware of the need to make things accessible, even if they are not involved in the technical aspects of accessible design. Accessibility needs to be an expectation; a normal way of thinking across the organization.

## Including the Accessibility Lead at a High Level

The Accessibility Lead needs to have enough authority to make a difference at a high level. There is a good chance that the decisions will impact some aspect of accessibility, and the impact may be negative if the people making the decisions don't think through the accessibility implications.
