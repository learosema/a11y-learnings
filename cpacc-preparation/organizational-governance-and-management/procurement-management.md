# Procurement Management

## Buy Accessible Products

If you have people with disabilities working within your organization (hopefully you do), you will need to take into account the accessibility of products when you buy them, to ensure your co-workers can use them.

If you don't, you may open your business up to legal risk. More importantly, you will be restricting the capabilities of your co-workers, which isn't good for them, and not good for the organization.

## Verifying Product Accessibility Claims

If a vendor claims that their product is disability-accessible, that's a good start. It's better than a vendor who doesn't know what you're talking about when you ask about disability access. But it's not enough.

Vendors can make any claim they like, whether or not it is true. You will want to verify that the claim is true. Ask for a sample or trial. Have one of your own trusted accessibility experts review the product and give a report. Compare the product to similar products by competing vendors.

After completing an accessibility review, share your results with the vendors to give them a chance to respond. You may learn some new things that you hadn't realized before. Or your assessment will be correct, and it will be a chance for the vendor to listen to feedback and improve the product.

## VPATs (Voluntary Product Accessibility Templates)

In the United States, vendors can publish a VPAT to explain what parts pass the Section 508 accessibility guidelines (if any), and what parts do not (if any). Not all vendors publish VPATs, and there is no third-party quality control or verification of VPAT claims, so VPATs are limited in their reliability.

You can consider the VPAT as one among many other factors when judging a product's accessibility, but you should not consider a VPAT sufficient proof by itself.

## Requiring Accessible Outcomes in Contractual Agreements

It is always good practice to include an accessibility clause in any contract that will produce content or products as part of the outcome. You should ensure that the contractor knows that accessibility is a requirement, and that you will have an accessibility expert evaluate the content or product.

## Verifying Contractor Accessibility Expertise and Capacity

Be sure to verify that the contractor actually knows how to accomplish the accessibility goals, or that they will work with someone else who has the necessary skills. Don't take the contractor's word at face value unless you or someone you trust has previously verified their accessibility competence.

## Leveraging Procurement Policies to Influence Third-Party Providers

If you tell a vendor that you can't use their product because it is not accessible, you can be certain that they will take note. 

They may not be able to fix the accessibility problem right away, but they will realize that it is an important priority for you, and that they just lost your business because of it.
