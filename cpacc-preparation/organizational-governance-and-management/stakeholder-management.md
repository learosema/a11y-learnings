# Stakeholder Management

One of the main tasks of a program or project manager is to manage expectations among various stakeholder groups. This involves listening to them, hearing their concerns, and identifying their priorities. Every situation will be different and will involve different sets of stakeholders.

If you are unfortunate enough to be under threat of a lawsuit, some of the most urgent stakeholder relationships will be with the lawyers and the groups represented by the lawyers. A judge, commission, or other government official or group may be another stakeholder in that situation.

## In a less stressful situation, the stakeholders would include, at a minimum:

- Your design, development, and testing team
- Your clients or users, including people with disabilities

You will want to make a list of all the important stakeholders and make sure you keep them all in mind, to some degree, throughout the process.
