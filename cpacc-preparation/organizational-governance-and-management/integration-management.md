# Integration Management

## Accessibility is a Process Management Challenge, Not Just a Technical Challenge
  
    "Accessibility is Change Management" - Dylan Barrell, CTO, Deque Systems

It can be tempting to think of accessibility just as a technical challenge—because certainly there are technical aspects to accessibility—but it is more than a technical challenge. It is also a process management challenge. Organizations need to permanently embed accessibility into the process of design, development, and testing.

Accessibility is a process/program, not a project.

## It Takes a Team

Integrating accessibility into the organization’s culture begins with creating a team specifically assigned to implement the change within the organization. The team’s responsibilities will include identifying the goals and objectives of implementing accessibility; selecting internal standards, best practices, resources and tools needed to incorporate accessibility; and specifying accessibility guidelines and policies for the entire organization.

The team should have a managerial leader who ensures that the team is upholding its responsibilities for addressing accessibility within the organization. Other members of the team should represent various departments and have an expressed interest in remediating accessibility issues.

## It Requires Expertise

You're fooling yourself if you think an organization can "get by" with a little bit of accessibility knowledge but no actual expertise. Somebody has to know accessibility very well, particularly in very technical domains of accessibility, such as web accessibility. Here are some ideas for maintaining accessibility expertise in an organization:

- Hire experts (and make sure they really are experts), OR
- Outsource the accessibility expertise, at least at first (eventually you'll want some in-house expertise)
- Train your team (with a combination of live training and online resources like [Deque University](https://dequeuniversity.com/))
- Make accessibility part of the on-boarding process for new hires
- Hire people with disabilities to be part of your team

## It Requires Commitment at the Executive Level

It is critical that the team has support and commitment from the executive level. An executive leader in accessibility not only empowers the team to make accessibility decisions and enforce policies, but an executive leader can make a public statement about the organization’s commitment to accessibility.
