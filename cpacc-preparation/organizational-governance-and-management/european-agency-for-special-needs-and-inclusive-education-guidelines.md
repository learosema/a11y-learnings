# European Agency for Special Needs and Inclusive Education Guidelines

The <strong>European Agency for Special Needs & Inclusive Education</strong> does work and supports endeavors related to disability inclusion. It has published free Guidelines that offer guidance to organizations seeking to produce accessible information.

## The 7 broad recommendations are:

1. Include an accessibility statement in the organization’s long-term strategy
2. Develop a strategy or plan for implementing accessible information
3. Make someone responsible for implementing the information accessibility plan and provide them with the required resources
4. Plan an incremental implementation – be ambitious and modest at the same time
5. Embed accessibility into your information production and dissemination processes
6. Provide information, education and training on accessibility for all staff
7. When outsourcing information production, make sure accessibility requirements are addressed and undergo a quality check

The Guidelines provide a model of how an organization could implement them:

## Policy

- Develop a long-term strategy that recognizes all aspects of disability
- Publish an accessibility statement
- Ensure the procurement policy covers accessibility compliance

## Plan

- Develop an information accessibility plan. It should be detailed and realistic and cover specific steps to follow
- Ensure the person or team responsible for the plan has the necessary authority and resources.

## Practice

- Enact a pilot trial of the guidelines
- Provide awareness training for staff
- Provide accessibility training for content specialists in tools to make information accessible.
- Create style guides and templates
- Use the style guides and templates to create information
- Ensure that external content providers (such as authors, web developers, media producers, etc.) are provided with the Guidelines and comply with them
- Test for accessibility prior to release
