# Risk Management

## Assessing Legal Liability

Legal risk varies from one country to another, and from one industry to another. Universities, financial institutions, government entities, transportation providers, and other providers of basic services are generally held to a higher standard than some other industries, and are therefore usually at greater legal risk.

The legal team will want to determine both the legal and financial risks associated with non-compliance.

## Prioritize Risks

Part of risk management is assessing which aspects of the design present the biggest accessibility barriers, and therefore the biggest legal risk.

For example, a bank may decide that the most important part of the web site to fix first would be the customer login and access to basic account information, such as monthly statements and online payments. Other aspects of the site, such as loan application forms, mortgage calculators, or promotional materials may take second priority, to be fixed after the first priority is taken care of.

## The Public Relations Implications of Non-Compliance

It doesn't look good when a business publicly fights a disability access lawsuit. Imagine a headline reading "XYZ Corporation Refuses to Make Web Site Accessible to Blind Users."

That kind of decision would be a public relations disaster. Most companies try to avoid negative publicity as much as possible, and a refusal to meet the needs of people with disabilities would be negative publicity.

To avoid negative publicity, companies can publicly demonstrate action towards addressing accessibility. One way to do this is to publish an accessibility statement that declares a company's commitment to accessibility and shows the public that the company is actively working towards achieving accessibility.

Additionally, companies can provide its stakeholders with feedback methods and processes that will help them improve accessibility and continue to implement accessibility throughout various parts of the company. The feedback a company receives from its own employees and clients can be a major contributor to enhancing accessibility within the company.

## Internal Accountability for Compliance

Within an organization, program and project managers need to hold people accountable for their respective roles in the accessibility process. Everyone needs to play their part.
