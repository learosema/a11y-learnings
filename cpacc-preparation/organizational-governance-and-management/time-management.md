# Time Management

## How Much "Extra" Time Does Accessibility Add?

One thing that a lot of managers want to know right away is how much extra time it's going to take to incorporate accessibility into the design process. This is kind of a trick question, because if you're always designing with accessibility in mind, then accessibility is never "extra." It's normal. It's the way things are done.

But for organizations that are just starting to take accessibility seriously, we have to be honest and say that it does take some time, and therefore money, to do accessibility right. So how much extra time does it take? The correct answer is "it depends," but let's take a closer look at what it depends on.

We'll use the example of web accessibility to discuss some of the considerations.

## Best-Case Scenario

In a best-case scenario, with all the best processes in place, an expert team, and uncomplicated content, accessibility tasks might add only 1% to 5% to the overall development time.

## Worst-Case Scenario

With an inexperienced team, an immature process, and highly complicated content, the estimate can balloon to much more than that, especially if the task is to fix existing content that is so badly inaccessible that it needs to be re-factored at a fundamental level. The accessibility tasks might double or triple the original development time in those scenarios. Much of that time would be spent learning what accessible design means, training the team, setting up a good process, and fixing a lot of trial-and-error mistakes along the way.

## Do You Have an Accessibility Lead or Coordinator?

Having a qualified person designated as the Accessibility Lead or Coordinator can help tremendously, because this person can manage the overall process, assign responsibilities, get involved at every stage of the process—from helping to write design requirements to providing technical expertise to ensuring a successful QA evaluation at the end.

Ideally this would be a full-time position, or possibly more than one full-time position. One person could specialize in the process side of accessibility, and another person could specialize in the technical side of accessibility. They would both be authorities within the organization.

## How Much Accessibility Experience Does Your Team Have?

If your team is experienced in accessible design, they will be more efficient. The experience needs to be at multiple levels of the organization, including:

- The executive team, planners, business analysts, product owners, project managers, and program managers
- UX designers, information architects, UI designers, and graphic designers
- Developers
- QA Testers
- Content writers
- Multimedia creators

## How Mature is Your Accessibility Process?

Even if you have an experienced team, if you have an immature or incomplete process, you won't be as efficient as you could be. The more completely accessibility is embedded into the process, from the very first steps, the more successful your accessibility efforts will be.

## Do You Already Have a Library of Accessible Widgets, Patterns, or Methods?

One of the most effective ways to save time is to have your team of accessibility experts create (and test) an official library of accessible (and reusable) widgets, patterns, and methods for the rest of the development team to use. If the rest of the team uses items from the library, they won't have to put any effort into making them accessible. They'll already be accessible.

## The Flexibility of Your Development Environment

If your development environment is very flexible, it may be relatively easy to add accessibility features to existing code. If you are using pre-packaged widgets (perhaps by a third-party vendor) that are difficult to edit, or if your development team doesn't have the expertise to edit the pre-packaged widgets, it will be harder and slower to create accessible versions of those scripts.

## Are You Starting a New Design or Retrofitting an Old Design?

When you are starting a new design, you have the ability to think about accessibility at every step along the way, saving you a lot of time in the long run.

If you're retrofitting an old design, everything you do is, by definition, extra time devoted to accessibility. You might get lucky. Sometimes the original designs can be modified relatively easily. Other times the designs are so tailored to people without disabilities that the whole concept has to be re-engineered to make it accessible.

## How Much Interactivity is There?

If there is a lot of interaction in a design, it will take longer to make that design accessible than a static design because there are so many more accessibility requirements to consider with highly interactive content.

## How Much Multimedia is There?

Adding accessibility features—like captions and transcripts—to multimedia can be time consuming. It can be even more time-consuming to add audio descriptions to videos, especially if the video does not have adequate pauses built into the soundtrack.

## How Much Math or Technical Data is There?

Math accessibility requires specialized knowledge, and it can be time-consuming to produce accessible digital math content.

## Will You be Using Any Automated Tools?

Automated tools like the [aXe browser extension](https://www.deque.com/axe/) and [aXe Monitor](https://www.deque.com/axe/monitor/) can save quite a bit of time during the development and testing stages. No automated tool can test everything—you still have to do some manual testing and testing with screen readers—but if you don't use any automated tools, you'll slow down the process.

## How Many Technology Configurations Will You Test?

If your goal is to test on every possible technology configuration with every possible assistive technology brand and version, and every possible user setting, you're going to be testing for a very long time. Even though it's true that the purpose of accessibility is to make things as accessible to as many people as possible, you can catch most of the problems by testing with a subset of technology configurations. One possible list of testing environments could be:

- Firefox (current version) with NVDA
- Internet Explorer (one version back) with JAWS
- Safari on iOS (current version) with VoiceOver

This combination won't catch every possible problem, but it will get you very close.

## The Real Goal Is to Make Accessibility "Business as Usual"

You want accessibility to be "business as usual." You don't want accessibility to be something that you do sometimes for some projects. That's a recipe for failure, and it means that every time you need to start a new accessibility project, you have to rebuild your process and your expertise, especially if some of your in-house accessibility experts have left the organization since the last accessibility project.

Once you achieve accessibility as a "business as usual" expectation, then it doesn't even make sense to ask the question of how much more accessibility costs, because the answer will be that it costs nothing extra. Accessibility is never optional. It's just the way we do things.
