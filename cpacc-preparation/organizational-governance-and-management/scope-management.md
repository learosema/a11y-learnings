# Scope Management

## What Does "Done" Mean?

What do you want to accomplish? Define clear goals with a clear end point so you'll know when you're done. Even though it's true that accessibility is an ongoing need, you still need to set clear expectations and milestones, or you may end up wasting too much time on issues that don't matter very much, and this can cause you to lose motivation.

## Categorizing Your Accessibility Efforts
Usually your scope can be defined within one of the following general categories:

- <strong>Innovation:</strong> Inventing new accessibility technologies or techniques
- <strong>New Design:</strong> Incorporating known accessibility best practices into a new product or project
- <strong>Retrofitting:</strong> Fixing the accessibility flaws in an existing product or project
- <strong>Maintenance:</strong> Ensuring that new product features don't break existing accessibility features

## Defining the Scope for Innovation Efforts

Most of the time you don't need to invent or innovate new accessibility solutions. The solutions are already out there. It's just a matter of identifying the right solutions, then implementing them.

Every once in a while, though, you may come up against a new problem that requires a new solution. That's an exciting thing to do! Still, setting the scope for inventing a new accessibility solution can be difficult to do. The most important thing is to write a clear problem statement. You might choose to do this as a "user story" along these lines:

```
AS a person with limited grip strength
I WANT to be able to pour milk into a bowl
SO THAT I can eat a bowl of cereal with milk in the morning without help from other people.
```

With a clear problem statement or user story, you can then begin to work on solutions that directly address the problem or need.

## Defining Scope for New Designs
A new design might be:

- A new product (e.g. web site, consumer item, etc.) that has never existed before
- A new component of the product
- A new method within a component
- A new interface for an existing component
- New content that has never existed before
- Or some variation on these ideas

When you're designing something new, you have the advantage that you can build the accessibility into the design from the beginning. This is MUCH better and easier than trying to add accessibility onto an existing design after the fact.

Make sure you involve an accessibility expert in the early design phase, in writing design requirements, writing test requirements, and in the quality assurance process.

## Defining Scope when Retrofitting Old Designs

You don't always have the luxury of working on new designs. Sometimes you have to fix old designs and add accessibility features onto them. That's always harder, and therefore more expensive, but realistically, sometimes that's what you have to do. One question to ask yourself is:

    Would it be better to fix the old design, or would it be better to start fresh and create a new design the right way, with embedded accessibility?

Your answer will depend on how recently the design was created, how bad the accessibility problems are in the existing design, and your other priorities at the time. If you just finished the existing design, you'll probably be reluctant to start over from the beginning, so you'll probably want to retrofit the existing design.

If the accessibility is extremely bad, it may be faster and easier to start over. That's a hard decision to make, but sometimes it's the best one. And if you have other priorities that coincide with creating a new design, then it makes sense to go ahead and do that. If not, you'll probably end up retrofitting.

When retrofitting, some basic tasks to consider for the scope are:

- Create an inventory of everything that needs to be assessed for accessibility
- Assess the items in the inventory, or assess a representative sample of the inventory, if the inventory is large
- Prioritize the accessibility fixes that need to be done

Once you know the size of the inventory and the depth of the accessibility problems, you will have a pretty good idea of the scope of the retrofitting project.

## Defining Scope During Maintenance

If you have a relatively stable design, with incremental changes introduced from time to time, you'll want to monitor the end product to ensure all of your hard work on accessibility doesn't go to waste when new components are added that are not accessible. If you're working on a web site, you may want to set up automated software, such as [aXe Monitor](https://www.deque.com/axe/monitor/) to scan through the site on a regular basis and produce reports. The software can identify new problems as they're introduced.

If new problems are introduced regularly, this points to a larger problem in your process. Revisit your overall accessibility strategy and ensure your team is always developing with accessibility in mind, rather than waiting until the maintenance step to find out if there are accessibility problems.
