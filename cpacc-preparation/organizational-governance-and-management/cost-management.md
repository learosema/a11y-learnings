# Cost Management

Cost management is closely related to [time management](time-management.md), which was the focus of the previous section. In fact, nearly all of the cost of accessibility will be in the time it takes to get things done.

There are a couple of possible exceptions:

## Third Party Accessibility Consultants

Sometimes it makes sense to hire third-party accessibility consultants, like Deque, to help with a project, especially on a short-term basis. The costs can vary widely, depending on the type of services you need. Services in a web development context might include:

- Evaluating existing web content
- Filing accessibility bugs in your bug tracking system
- Training your team
- Working side-by-side with your developers
- Consulting with management on accessibility process strategies
- Creating accessible content
- Fixing inaccessible content
- Software

Accessibility software can be another expense. Free browser extensions like [aXe](https://www.deque.com/axe/) don't add any cost, but enterprise-level applications like [aXe Monitor](https://www.deque.com/axe/monitor/) (which can scan entire web sites and produce comprehensive reports) are more expensive.

You may also need to invest in licenses of assistive technologies like JAWS or ZoomText.
