# Business Disability Forum Accessibility Maturity Model

The Business Disability Forum developed the Accessibility Maturity Model to aid organizations in conducting a self-assessment to track and plan their accessibility progress.

This model is based on the Accessible Technology Charter, which spells out 10 commitments to good practice on accessible information and communications technology (ICT). They are:

1. We will appoint an Executive Level Technology Champion who will report to the board, raise awareness of the benefits of this agenda and ensure that we achieve continuous improvement in this area.
2. We will ensure that colleagues are aware of how technology can liberate the contribution of everyone, as colleagues and customers.
3. We will routinely consult with disabled colleagues, customers and experts to ensure that we understand the impact of our technology on talent management, colleague productivity and our diverse customer base.
4. We will enable built in accessibility to allow reasonable personalization of technology by our colleagues and customers.
5. We will embed and promote a workplace adjustment process, that provides usable technology solutions for disabled colleagues, within a reasonable timeframe.
6. We will give our relevant teams the accessibility know-how needed to deliver effective business processes and adjustments for disabled colleagues and customers.
7. We will establish our performance baseline using the Accessibility Maturity Model. We will consistently go beyond minimum compliance to bring greater benefits to our business and share best practices with others.
8. We will promote a development lifecycle for our technology solutions that is based on inclusive design from definition to delivery, to minimize the cost and reputational risk triggered by retrofitting products and systems.
9. We will include accessibility as a key requirement within our procurement process and build relationships with supply partners to develop and deliver accessible products and services.
10. We will continuously improve accessibility within our organization, document what works and share our learning with the Technology Taskforce.
