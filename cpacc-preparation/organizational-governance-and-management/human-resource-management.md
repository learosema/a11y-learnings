## Recruiting and Integrating Employees with Disabilities

As has been noted elsewhere in this course, hiring people with disabilities can be one of the greatest ways to incorporate accessibility into the workflow. They are the true experts on what it is like to access the world with a disability.

Note that in many countries (such as the United States) it would be against the law to discriminate against people with disabilities, so in principle you should already have people with disabilities working alongside you. The reality, though, is that people with disabilities face "soft" discrimination all the time.

They often are not hired for jobs that they could perform because the employer is afraid of the perceived extra costs or inconveniences that the disability may impose on the organization. The employer may not say that the reason for not hiring the person was because of a disability, but many times that is the real reason. This kind of thinking needs to change.

## Recruiting Accessibility Talent

Employers should advertise positions that require accessibility expertise. They could even require that the applicant be CPACC-certified. One thing to note is that you're also going to want to give your employees the opportunity to increase their accessibility expertise, even if they advertise themselves as accessibility experts.

Sometimes the "experts" have some experience but not enough to actually do the full extent of the job. That can be ok as long as you trust that the person has the capacity to learn the expertise, and as long as you give the person time and opportunities to continue learning.

## Workforce Development and Training

You probably already have a team of developers, testers, designers, managers, and other roles. They probably are not accessibility experts. Not all of them have to become accessibility experts, but some of them do, and all of them have to at least become aware of accessibility basics.

Give your employees professional development opportunities. It's a way to invest in your own organization, for the benefits of your clients or customers whom you serve.
