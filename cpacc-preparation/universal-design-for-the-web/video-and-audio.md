# Video & Audio

## Don't Assume Everyone Can See Video or Hear Audio

### Captions, Transcripts, and Audio Descriptions
Provide synchronized captions for the deaf, synchronized audio descriptions for the blind, and a text transcript for those who are both deaf and blind.

## Captions

If you can't hear, you won't be able to make much sense of the video below. Fortunately, this video has captions. If captions are not already turned on in your browser, you may need to click on the "CC" (Closed Caption) icon to see the captions.

## Transcripts

A transcript is also a good idea, and in fact is the only way to make video or audio content accessible to someone who is both deaf and blind. The transcript can be converted into braille, to be read on a refreshable braille output device.

Accessibility stories brought to you by Deque.

My name is Corbb, and this is my Accessibility Story. I just graduated from the George Washington University, and while I was there, I found myself the last few semesters wanting to use more screen readers or use more braille. And a lot of the resources that colleges and professors are using are not currently accessible. I would have to spendâ€”as a blind student, I would spend $150.00 on a textbook, on a paper textbook, that I couldn't use. We would have to spend time making that book accessible.

I am sometimes frustrated that I have to be less efficient. I can still use Facebook by zooming, for example. But I'm not able to use it as efficiently as I would like to. I find myself getting headaches in the afternoon because I've had to struggle to see things. I find myself working harder to do the most routine task of data entry rather than saving that extra brain power for tasks like strategic thinking and directing a vision or a mission of a company that we're working with.

Oak Consulting Groups mostly works with nonprofits and small companies in their internal and external communications. Having an accessible Internet has been crucial for the work that we are able to do for our clients.

So much of market research is so much more accessible now because everything is one search engine away, and because I rely heavily on newspapers not just in my local area, but where my clients are located and national papers, having services like NFB Newsline that allow me to access newspapers in a way that a sighted person would. Just being able to flip through a paper very quickly and very easily, and being able to use those websites to go through the archives has really made a difference.

Web accessibility literally saved my back. I was so used to using my vision that I would zoom the computer screen and lean in to the point that I was staring at my computer all throughout college with a hunched back, and a few years ago, would have probably been sitting like this. But because I've been able to use braille and use the speech output from my computer through accessible websites and accessible computer programs, I can sit up straight, which is great to be able to do that in a meeting and look confident. It's also great because it saves me some chiropractic bills when I'm able to just sit up and do my work and not focus on seeing my work, but focus on thinking and doing the work that needs to be done.

When a blind person is deciding "do I go into an exciting and fun and flexible world of starting my own business," my advice is, go for it.

## Audio Descriptions
Someone who is blind will have no trouble with the video above, because the only thing to see is a person talking, and the blind person can already hear that just fine. But for videos with lots of visual activity, if there is no accompanying narration or dialog to explain the visual activity, the blind person will not understand what's happening. To make that kind of video accessible to a blind person, you need to provide a version of the video with audio descriptions. Audio descriptions are a recording of a person explaining the visual aspects of the video that aren't in the video's original dialog or narration. Audio description works best when users can turn it on or off, or when there is a separate version of the video with audio descriptions for blind users, in addition to the original version without audio descriptions.

## Audio Description Example(s)

A great example of a video with audio description can be found at [3playmedia Audio Description Examples](https://www.3playmedia.com/learn/how-to-guides/audio-description-how-to-guides/audio-description-examples/).

Note: Press the AD button on to hear the audio description. The narrator voice you hear is not part of the original video. That narrator voice is the audio description. Press the AD button again to turn off the audio description (AD) track.

A variety of audio description examples can also be found at [Audio Description Samples](https://audiodescribe.com/samples/). Unfortunately, these videos are not fully accessible because they do not provide closed captions. They also have no way to turn the audio description off. Best practice is for the audio description track to be separate from the regular audio track for the video.
