## Link Destinations Should Not Be Mysterious

### Link Text
Ensure the link text clearly explains the destination or purpose of the link.

## Example 

Before clicking on the links below, do you know where the links will take you?

- [Deque Home Page](https://www.deque.com)
- [Click here](#)

Chances are that you were able to correctly assume that the link to "Deque Home Page" would take you to the Deque home page, but you probably had no idea where the "click here" link would take you, did you?

## Why meaningful Link Text matters

You may not think that having good link text is all that important for disability accessibility, but here's why it matters:

Screen reader users will frequently use the tab key to go through the links on the page, or they will use a keyboard shortcut to pull up a list of links. It's one way that screen reader users skim through the content to find out what navigation options are available to them.

When screen readers read links this way, they ignore all of the text around the links and read only the link text. If one or more links says something meaningless like "click here," or "more...", or other similar phrases, screen reader users can't tell what the link is for or where it goes.

Also, good link text makes the navigation more understandable for everyone, including people with cognitive disabilities.
