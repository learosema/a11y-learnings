# Contrast

## Don't Assume Everyone Has Perfect Vision

### Ensure Sufficient Contrast

Ensure the contrast of the text against the background is sufficient to allow the text to be read easily.

Some people with low vision see in low contrast, making it hard for them to read text if the color and brightness of the text are too similar to the background behind the text. You don't always have to use the highest contrast (white against black or black against white), but you do need to choose colors that don't make reading difficult.

## Examples

- Black text on white background: good contrast â¬›â¬œ
- Red text on blue background: bad contrast ðŸŸ¥ðŸŸ¦
