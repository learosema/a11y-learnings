## Make the Original PDF Document Accessible or Provide an Accessible Alternative

### Tagged PDF

To make a PDF document accessible, it must be in "tagged PDF" format, and must be edited for reading order, tab order, and other semantic and structural markup. Also provide an accessible alternative to the PDF document.

## Tagged PDF

You can add markup to PDF files in much the same way that you add markup to HTML files, creating what is known as a "tagged PDF" file. You can mark text as headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and other semantic elements. You can mark images and give them alt text. You can create tables and mark up the row and column headers. Most of the important tags that are available in HTML are also available in PDF documents.

To create a tagged PDF file, it's best to start with a good accessible document in an authoring tool like Microsoft Word or Adobe InDesign. Both of these programs can convert to tagged PDF rather smoothly. To do so, though, you'll need Acrobat Pro. The free Adobe Reader can read tagged PDF files, but it can't create them.

As it turns out, there are a lot of software tools out there that can create plain PDF files, but the vast majority don't create tagged PDF files. They create untagged files that are inaccessible to screen readers. You will need Acrobat Pro to help with the conversion to tagged PDF and the touchup of the file after the conversion.

## PDF Accessibility Support for Windows and Mac

For a long time, PDF accessibility support was only available through Windows, but not through Mac. Now, with the latest update to Adobe Acrobat DC and Reader DC, accessibility support and remediation are available to both Mac OS X and Windows users. Mac users can now use VoiceOver to create, edit, and read PDF documents.
