## Headings Facilitate Navigation and Add Semantic Structure

Use headings to create a properly-structured outline of the page. This outline helps organize the content, and also improves navigation for screen reader users.

Screen reader users must listen to web content, which means they can't just glance at a page to quickly see where the main content begins. The top of most web pages includes a lot of navigation links, and it can take a while to get past that to arrive at the beginning of the main content. 

Even after arriving at the main content, it can be difficult to get the gist of the page's structure and organization, especially on long web pages with lots of text.

Headings are a way to help speed up navigation and make the structure of the page easier to understand. Headings speed up the navigation because screen readers have keyboard shortcuts that allow users to jump from heading to heading, skipping over all of the text between headings. Navigating through headings like this makes it easier to understand what the page is about and how the page is structured.

This works only if you use real headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>? , etc.) and if your headings are organized well. If you don't use any headings, or if the headings don't use the appropriate HTML tags, or if the headings are structured poorly, screen reader users will have a harder time making their way through the content.
