# Keyboard Accessibility

## Don't Assume Everybody Uses a Mouse

Ensure that all functionality is keyboard-accessible, that the tab order is logical, and that the focus indicator is always visible to sighted keyboard users.

## Keyboard Functionality

Users need to be able to tab to all links, forms, and dynamic content, and they need to be able to operate it using the keyboard. It is never acceptable to have a web page or widget that can be used only with the mouse. Some widgets, especially the more complex ones, may require the use of the enter or return key (to activate links, forms, or buttons), arrow keys (for navigating between items in lists or tabs), space bar (for activating buttons and checking or unchecking elements) or combinations of keys (such as shift + down arrow to select multiple items in a drop-down list).

## Tab Order

As you tab through the focusable objects on a page, the order should be logical. Ask yourself if the order would make sense if you couldn't see the rest of the page, and the only thing you could hear was the text in the objects with the tab focus.

## Visual Focus Indicator

Don't forget sighted keyboard users! Not all keyboard users are blind. Sighted keyboard users need to see where the focus is at all times. Usually browsers will put a dotted line or a glowing line around the object in focus, as long as you don't turn this feature off in your styles (don't turn it off in your styles!).

In some browsers, like Firefox and Internet Explorer, the small grey dotted line is too subtle for people with low vision to see well. You can use CSS to enhance the visual focus indicator by adding a background color, or a more visible outline, or a more obvious color change for the text.
