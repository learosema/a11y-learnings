# Universal Design for the Web

## What Universal Design Means

Create products and environments that the vast majority of people can use, taking into account our natural physical diversity.

Note that the concept of universal design is broader than the concept of accessible design for people with disabilities. Universal design attempts to create designs that apply to people with or without disabilities. See the [Wikipedia entry about Universal Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_design)

Universal design is a proactive approach, benefitting a wide range of users. Whereas, providing accommodations is a reactive approach. In other words, specific adjustments are made to meet the needs of a person with a disability.

There are lots of reasons to get excited about the concept of universal design. The potential payback is huge, because it benefits a wide range of people. Why design for just a segment of the population, when you can take on the ambition of designing for everyone? 

Sometimes universal design is pretty straightforward, and sometimes it is a challenge. Take on the thrill of the challenge! It will broaden your perspective and push you to new creative areas you may never have considered before. Be a pioneer!
