# For People with Disabilities

## Accessibility Improves People's Lives

This is the biggest and most important benefit. Accessible designs make life easier for people with disabilities. Or, in some cases, it's even more dramatic: accessibility makes things possible that would be otherwise literally impossible. In this sense, accessibility isn't just nice to have, it's necessary.

Accessible web sites let people conduct their personal banking, make restaurant reservations, access government benefits, apply for college, shop online, read the news, play online games... and anything else that is available on the web.

Accessible transportation systems make it possible for people with disabilities to go to work, visit friends and family, go to entertainment venues, go to restaurants, and so on. Inaccessible transportation systems mean that people with disabilities have to stay home or rely on help from others to get to places.

Accessible architecture makes it possible for people with disabilities to enter and actually use buildings, including public spaces, private businesses, and personal homes of friends and family.
