# For People Without Disabilities

## Accessible Designs Improve Access for All
Here are just a few examples of how accessible design benefits people without disabilities:

Accessibility Feature                           | Benefits for People Without Disabilities
------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------
Curb cuts on sidewalks for wheelchair access	  | Curb cuts also allow easy access for strollers, 
                                                | bicycles, carts, dollies and hand trucks, 
                                                | and anything else with wheels.
------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------
Elevators for wheelchair access	                | Anyone can use an elevator, which can save us 
                                                | physical effort, especially in tall buildings. 
                                                | Plus, it's easier to move furniture and other
                                                | large or heavy objects.
------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------
Dual height drinking fountains side by side     | Other people, such as children and people in 
(one for people of average height, and one for  | wheelchairs, can access the shorter 
shorter people, such as people with dwarfism)	  | drinking fountains more easily.
------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------
Auto-opening doors, for wheelchair              | People who have their hands full can enter the 
accessibility	                                  | building without having to put things down.
                                                |

## Less Burden on Family Members and Helpers

Family members and helpers of people with disabilities frequently share the burden of a world not designed with disability in mind. Inaccessible environments often require two people to do things that should only require one person, which can be an inconvenience for both. Inaccessible print materials, for example, may require a helper to read the text aloud to a blind person. If the print were available in an accessible format to begin with, the blind person could read it herself.

## The Opportunity to Befriend More People with Disabilities

If the world were more accessible, there would be more social contact between people with and without disabilities, potentially leading to an increased number of friendships between them.

This would enrich our lives, not because people with disabilities are "inspirational" (see Stella Young's talk, ["I'm not your inspiration, thank you very much"](https://www.ted.com/talks/stella_young_i_m_not_your_inspiration_thank_you_very_much?language=en)), but because we all need friendships, and having a genuine friendship with a person with a disability can help dispel many of the feelings of anxiety and discomfort that people in the general population often have about disabilities in general.
