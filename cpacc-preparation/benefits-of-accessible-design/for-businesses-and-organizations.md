# For Businesses and Organizations

## Accessibility Improves Public Perception

If you have an accessible web site, it shows that you—and the organization you work for—are committed to basic ideals of equal opportunity and fairness. You can leverage your accessible web site as a differentiator among your competitors or peers who may have less accessible web sites. You show that you care.

## Accessibility Increases Compatibility

Your web site will be compatible with a wider variety of web-enabled devices, because designing for accessibility requires that you pay attention to the robustness of your web site in many platforms, browsers, and devices using a variety of input methods.

## Accessibility Improves Search Engine Optimization

Many of the techniques required for accessibility involve smart use of semantic markup in the text and in the HTML, which also improves the ability of search engines to find and index your work with the appropriate keywords. Your users and potential customers will find your web site more easily.

## Accessibility Increases Your Customer Base

People with disabilities have money to spend. If they can access your web site, and if they like what you have to sell, they'll probably buy it. If they can't access your web site, it doesn't matter much if they like what you have to sell, because they can't go through the steps of purchasing anything. Accessibility benefits your bottom line.

## Accessibility Increases Your Eligibility for Funding

If you do any contract work with government entities, chances are that you will be required to agree to make your deliverables accessible, because governments are often required to write those conditions in the requests for proposals. If you know how to make your deliverables accessible, and if you have a track record to prove that you have already done so in the past, you will be more likely to get the contract.

## Accessibility Helps You Avoid Lawsuits

In many areas of the world, creating inaccessible web sites is against the law. The legal picture isn't always straightforward, but people with disabilities have rights, and they might decide to sue your company if the web site is not accessible. That's bad press, a huge expense, and it's totally avoidable if you create an accessible web site in the first place. Accessibility keeps you out of court.
