# Challenges & Solutions for People who are Deafblind

## Learning Goals

The CPACC exam will ask you questions that show you know how to:

1. Identify accessibility challenges that people who are deafblind experience.
2. Match the challenges with appropriate:
  - Assistive technologies (products or items that people can use)
  - Adaptive strategies (methods to work around or avoid the challenges)

## Deafblindness: Examples of Challenges and Solutions

### Information Communication Technology (ICT)

#### Challenge: Digital text cannot be seen

- A screen reader can convert text to braille on a refreshable braille device, or "printed" in a braille embosser.

#### Challenge: Audio (including the audio portion of videos) cannot be heard

- A text transcript of the audio can be converted to refreshable braille by a screen reader, or "printed" in a braille embosser.
