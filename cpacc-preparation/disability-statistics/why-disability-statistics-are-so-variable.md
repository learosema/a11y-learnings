# Why Disability Statistics Are So Variable

## Differences in How "Disability" is Defined

There are many different ways to define the concept of "disability" and the surveys used to collect disability statistics don't all use the same definition. In fact, the definitions vary widely. Narrow definitions will result in smaller percentages of people reporting a disability. Broader definitions will result in larger percentages.

## Differences in Data Collection Methods

Some surveys rely on individuals to report their own disabilities. Others rely on observations or data collection activities by the people administering the survey. These collection methods can cause wide variance in the results.

Also, if the purpose of the data collection is to determine whether a person is eligible for government benefits, people are more likely to report a disability than in other circumstances where reporting a disability may result in negative consequences or social stigma.

The wording of the questions on a survey also matters. If a survey simply asks, "Do you have a disability?" (or other similarly vague question), the results won't be as accurate or as meaningful as the answers to more precise questions, such as, "Do you experience difficulty seeing text well enough to read it, even when wearing glasses?" Surveys can ask follow-up questions to get answers that are even more precise.

## Political or Public Relations Biases

Sometimes a country or organization may be reluctant to report accurate numbers about people with disabilities because of a fear that the report will shine an unfavorable light on the situation. Under these circumstances it may be impossible to get accurate data until the fear has been addressed.

For the sake of comparison to a different kind of data, the mayor of Sochi, in Russia, once [claimed there were no gays in Sochi](http://abcnews.go.com/WN/gay-people-sochi-mayor-claims/story?id=22166765), due to the perceived negative association with homosexuality in Russia at the time, even though his claim was essentially impossible, from a statistical standpoint. That kind of bias against perceived stigma will complicate data collection and make the results unreliable.

## Comparing Statistics Across Countries

For all of these reasons, it is difficult to compare disability statistics across countries, or even across different surveys in the same country. Even so, we do have data about disabilities, and it is worthwhile to learn from the data of each study, even if it is difficult to compare the data across studies.
