# Education Levels & Literacy

## Disability is Linked to Lower Education Levels

People with disabilities tend to be less educated than the general population. In the case of severe disabilities, the individuals may not be capable of completing a traditional education through the school system. In other cases, though, the education system is not adequately equipped to handle students with disabilities, or there are other barriers that reduce the availability and/or quality of education for students with disabilities.

The consequence of the lower education levels is that people with disabilities may not be as qualified for jobs as other candidates, so the jobs are less likely to go to candidates with disabilities. This can lead to a vicious cycle of poverty and lost opportunities that can be extremely difficult for people with disabilities to overcome.
