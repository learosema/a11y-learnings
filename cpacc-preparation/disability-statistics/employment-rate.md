# Employment Rate

## Disabilities (and Workplace Discrimination) are Linked to Unemployment

Personal circumstances vary greatly, but statistically speaking, people with disabilities as a group tend to be disproportionately represented among those who are unemployed or under-employed, even after taking their disability into account. In a minority of cases, the disability itself and/or related health issues severely limit the individual's ability to work, or prevent it entirely. In most cases, though, people with disabilities are willing and able to perform in the job market when given the chance. Workplace discrimination and inaccessible work environments often reduce the employment opportunities for people with disabilities.
