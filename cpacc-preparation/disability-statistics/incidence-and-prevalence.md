# Incidence and Prevalence

## What Percentage of the Population Has a Disability?

Estimates for the percentage of people with a disability range from about 10% to 20%, depending on the survey methodology, definition of the word "disability," and other factors. This means that in a random group of 10 people worldwide, 1 or 2 of those people are likely to have a disability.

That's a minority, but it's a rather sizable minority. Of the approximately 7 billion people on the planet, about 700 million to 1.4 billion have disabilities.

We are all susceptible to disabilities. An able-bodied person can acquire a disability through an illness or an accident, which can dramatically change the person's ability to interact with a world that isn't designed with accessibility in mind. (See the online article [Chances of Disability (Me, Disabled?)](https://disabilitycanhappen.org/disability-statistic/) by the Council for Disability Awareness.)
