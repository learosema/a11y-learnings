# Civil Rights Laws

A civil right is an individualâ€™s right to freedom and to equal treatment, to not be subjected to discrimination based on certain characteristics. Civil rights legislation looks to protect rights such as privacy and freedom of speech, as well as protect people from discrimination in multiple settings, such as employment, housing, public spaces, and education.

To protect people with disabilities, countries like the United States and Japan have enacted laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability and protect the rights of people with disabilities. Below are a few of the common laws that protect rights for people with disabilities.

## United States

### The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)

The ADA is a broad civil rights law that prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in employment, architectural design, transportation, examinations and courses, and other services offering "public accommodation."

Even though the ADA says nothing about web accessibility explicitly, many of the web accessibility lawsuits in the United States invoke the ADA as the basis for the legal complaint, because of the language about "public accommodation."

#### The ADA applies to:

- Private entities that own, operate, lease, or lease to places of public accommodation. Essentially this refers to businesses and other organizations open to the public, with the exception of religious entities and private clubs.
- Federal and state government entities.

#### The ADA is enforced by:

- Consumers (people with disabilities) filing formal complaints

## Canada

### Ontario: The Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)

The AODA "applies to every person or organization in the public and private sectors of the Province of Ontario, including the Legislative Assembly of Ontario" if the person or organization "provides goods, services or facilities... employs persons in Ontario... offers accommodation... owns or occupies a building, structure or premises... or is engaged in a prescribed business, activity or undertaking or meets such other requirements as may be prescribed."

## United Kingdom

### The Equality Act of 2010

One of the main laws related to web accessibility in the UK is the Equality Act of 2010. The Equality Act is a broad law which prohibits discrimination in the workplace and in society in general on the basis of:

- Disability
- Race or ethnic identity
- Sex
- Pregnancy or parenthood status
- Sexual orientation or identity
- Religion, belief, or lack of religion/belief

The Equality Act replaced and now supersedes three laws that named specific populations:

- Sex Discrimination Act 1975
- Race Relations Act 1976
- Disability Discrimination Act 1995

Bringing the legislation for all of these types of protect populations and conditions under one law helps simplify the legal situation in terms of civil rights in the public sector. Citizens may file a complaint and pursue legal action if warranted.

The Equality Act applies specifically to public authorities "and to any other organisation when it is carrying out a public function."

According to Out-law.com:

  While the EQA does not expressly refer to websites, the consensus has been that the reference to the "provision of a service" applies to commercial web services as much as to traditional services.

## Japan

The Act on the Elimination of Discrimination against Persons with Disabilities
One of the actions Japan took to eradicate social barriers for people with disabilities was establishing the Act on the Elimination of Discrimination against Persons with Disabilities in June 2013. The legislation prohibits discrimination based on disability and requires organizations and private entities to provide the necessary accommodations that remove the social barriers people with disabilities face.
