# Procurement Laws

Procurement refers to the process of government entities purchasing goods and services from external sources. There are laws and rules in place, though, that regulate government procurement to ensure that money is spent wisely and to prevent fraud and waste from occurring.

When it comes to procuring technologies, there are laws that specifically spell out standards and requirements for purchasing, and these requirements may even address accessibility. Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act and EN 301 549 are two examples of procurement laws that focus on accessibility.

## United States

### Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act

Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act requires the U.S. federal government to take accessibility into account when procuring information technologies: websites, telephones, copiers, computers, and other technologies, including both hardware and software. 

The parts of Section 508 most relevant to web accessibility are

- 1194.21 — Software applications and operating systems
- 1194.22 — Web-based intranet and internet information and applications
- 1194.31 — Functional performance criteria.

In January 2017, Section 508 underwent a refresh that was many years in the making. A significant change is that the WCAG level A and AA guidelines are now incorporated by reference and required by Section 508.

Prior to the refresh, Section 508 included its own list of requirements, which were a modified subset of WCAG 1.0 (not the current version of WCAG).

#### Section 508 applies to:

- US federal government entities only, but the effects of Section 508 have permeated the information technology landscape because so many businesses, non-profits, and local and state governments do business with the federal government. To sell to the federal government, private entities have to offer accessible products and services.

#### Section 508 is enforced by:

- Consumers (people with disabilities) filing formal complaints

## Europe

### EN 301 549: "Accessibility requirements suitable for public procurement of ICT products and services in Europe"

[EN 301 549 (pdf)](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf) is the European standard of Accessibility requirements for Information and Communications Technology (ICT) products and services in the European Union. The norm is developed by the European Standardization Committees [CEN, CENELEC](https://www.cencenelec.eu/) and [ETSI](https://www.etsi.org/).

All (semi) public sector websites in the European Union (EU) have to meet the standard as of September 23, 2020. All mobile apps in the (semi) public sector have to meet the standard by June 23, 2021. This is drawn up in the [Web Accessibility Directive 2016/2102](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016L2102) that is transposed into national legislation in all EU member states. Public sector bodies have to comply, and need to prove their level of accessibility through an accessibility statement against the EN standard. This report can not be older than 3 years.

The European standard adopts the latest version of the W3C’s [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) which help support many laws and standards around the world. In this case, it directly references WCAG 2.1 AA and follows the same structure for Web (Chapter 9), Non-web documents (Chapter 10) and non-web software like mobile apps (Chapter 11). EN 301 549 also follows the same underlying WCAG principles: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust (P.O.U.R.).

The European Commission published an overview of the [latest changes in the 3.2.1 version](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/latest-changes-accessibility-standard).

Like WCAG, EN 301 549 has three levels of conformance: A, AA, and AAA. Level A refers to the lowest level of conformance (minimum) and Level AAA is the highest (maximum). Level AA is the mandatory level. It is not recommended that Level AAA conformance be required as a general policy for entire sites because it is not possible to satisfy all Level AAA Success Criteria for some content.

#### Important EN 301 549 Considerations

There are a few situations within Europe where a more specific local law or standard takes transcends EN 301 549. Examples are BITV in Germany and RGAA in France.

EN 301 549 is also unique in that it goes beyond WCAG, extending to cover biometrics. The standard requires people with disabilities to have access to technology that scans biological data, including facial recognition and fingerprints. While this may not be a prominent ICT for all, knowing it may be on the horizon for you is an important consideration.

### EU Directive 2019/882 or European Accessibility Act

For the private sector, Europe developed the <strong>EU Directive 2019/882</strong>. This directive is applicable to specific sectors including e-commerce, banking, e-books, and electronics. This EU directive must be transposed into national law by June 28, 2022. The legislation will apply from <strong>28 June 2025</strong>. EN 301 549 is expected to be the applicable standard for European industry.

Businesses should start implementing the standard as soon as possible to be ready in 2025 and thus make sure it fits into their development plans and processes.
