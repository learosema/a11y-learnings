# UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities

The [Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN CRPD)](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html) of the United Nations (UN) is the most important political and democratic expression of the will to grant and guarantee equal human rights to people with disabilities at a global level.

The UN-Convention is the result of many long lasting political civil rights movements driving and anchoring the paradigmatic shift from the personal deficit (medical, charity, protection) oriented model of disability towards an inclusive, equal chances and human rights model (social, environmental adaptation model) (see: [Theoretical Models of Disability](../theoretical-models-of-disability)).

As an international ratified treaty, the UN CRPD is an instrument to push and monitor national legislation, administration and the implementation and provision of Accessibility, AT and universal design as integral parts and means to guarantee equal human rights to people with disabilities.

## History and Background

The roots of the <abbr title="UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities">UN CRPD</abbr> go back to the 1980s, which was proclaimed as the decade of people with disabilities by the United Nations. 

The political goals included overcoming the still dominating deficit-oriented medical model of disability, fighting segregation and exclusion, reducing discrimination and awareness, policy, administration and practice towards equal human rights, accessibility and inclusion.

This decade provoked an intense political debate about rules, standards and requirements for inclusion driven by the [International Disability Alliance](https://www.internationaldisabilityalliance.org/), which is still ongoing. In 2000 a group of NGOs came up with a declaration calling all nations to support a convention to promote and protect the rights and dignity of persons with disabilities.

This successfully focused the diverse interest and activities into drafting the convention and getting it accepted. Again, many objections and political discussion followed, but the convention became quickly adopted: 160 United Nations member states signed and ratified it.

In 2008 the <strong>Optional Protocol</strong> was launched, which implements the competencies and rights of the <strong>Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities</strong> to monitor and accept complaints. This Protocol provides a tool to make the UN CRPD operational and impacting in practice. It has been signed by 92 nations till today ([Overview to signing and ratifying the UN CRPD](https://indicators.ohchr.org/)).

(The USA signed but did not ratify the UN CRPD. The two-third majority was not reached in senate in 2012.)

## Impact of the <abbr title="UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities">UN CRPD</abbr>

The UN CRPD is a binding human rights treaty and serves as a framework for legal advocacy. With its Optional Protocol it provides a powerful tool for monitoring and claiming for equal rights. It has become a key instrument for people with disabilities to fight discrimination and exclusion and to promote, implement, monitor and defend inclusion, accessibility and equal opportunities.

## Domains Addressed

The UN CRPD uses a holistic approach. It declares and grants equal rights for people with disabilities the status and level of human rights, being “universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated”. On this basis it defines in 50 articles obligations of governments to guarantee the rights of people with disabilities in

- Respecting principles for communication about and with people with disabilities
- Accessing health care, habilitation and rehabilitation
- Defining and providing reasonable accommodation and accessibility
- Using assistive technologies
- Accessing information including information technology
- Supporting independent living and self-determined decisions
- Fostering personal mobility (buildings, transports, public spaces)
- Participating in social, economic, employment, educational, political, recreational, sport, cultural, and legal activities
- Allowing and facilitating monitoring and reporting the progress and claiming disrespect by national and international human rights institutions

## Digital Accessibility and the UN CRPD

The convention in almost all articles refers (explicitly or implicitly) to progress in the provision of ICT, AT, accessibility and universal design. It makes evident that inclusion and participation is, of course, independent from any technology as it is a democratic, political, social and cultural process.

But it underlines that the digital accessibility revolution, the adaptability and flexibility of designing our environment, is the central tool and core driving force for its implementation. ICT, AT, accessibility and universal design make the UN CRPD operational and its implementation reasonable at a very practical level. This is outlined in many articles, for example:

- <strong>Assistive Technology:</strong>
  - Article 4.1 g: General Obligations
  - Article 20 b,d: Personal Mobility
  - Article 27 (3): Habilitation and Rehabilitation
  - Article 29 a (ii): Participation in public and political life
  - Article 32 1.d: International Cooperation
- <strong>Accessibility:</strong>
  - Article 3 f: General Principles
  - Article 4.1 h: General Obligations
  - Article 9: Accessibility
- <strong>Universal Design:</strong>
  - Article 2: Definition
  - Article 4.1 f: General Obligations

We might argue that the UN CRPD could not have been written at the practical scope it has and met with fast and unanimous acceptance without <abbr title="Information and Communication Technology">ICT</abbr>, <abbr title="Assistive Technology">AT</abbr>, accessibility and universal design as its practical driving forces.

## Referring to and Using the UN CRPD

The UN CRPD is a high-level instrument for political and legislative activities in the disability movement. It is also a reference for awareness raising and outlining the importance of inclusion.

It underlines that the shift towards accessibility, AT and equal participation in the digital society is irreversible, asking for professional and sustainable answers at all levels and by all stakeholders. It is one of the most powerful arguments we have at hand.

But the UN CRPD includes a very practical tool we must not neglect and underestimate: [The Monitoring, Reporting and Claiming Process](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Publications/Disabilities_training_17EN.pdf) implemented and guaranteed by all ratifying states. 

This process, involving end user organizations as the key facilitators, monitors and reports on the state of the art, activities, and progress; but also shortcomings, discrimination and exclusion.

This mechanism brings forth the agenda for accessibility and demonstrates for all cases that accessibility can be reasonably implemented, in particular with the digital accessibility resources. Guidelines, techniques, and tools exist and are ready to be used. There is no excuse not to move towards accessibility.

Getting involved and using this powerful process must not be neglected as a means for political, legal, administrative but also very practical accessibility issues.
