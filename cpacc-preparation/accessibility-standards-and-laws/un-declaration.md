# The Universal Declaration of Human Rights

As a result of the tragedy and loss experienced during the Second World War, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on December 10, 1948, in Paris, France. The document is known to be the first of its kind to establish fundamental human rights, for it declares rights that everyone in the world should have.

It is also regarded as the foundation of international human rights law as numerous international treaties, constitutions, and other laws have elaborated on the rights contained in the document, especially accessibility laws.

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was commissioned in 1946 by the Commission on Human Rights, led by committee chair, Eleanor Roosevelt.

The 18 members of the Commission who drafted the document represented different cultural backgrounds, political backgrounds, and nationalities from all over the world.

The document consists of a preamble that spells out the reasons for the document and 30 articles that state fundamental human rights ranging from right to life, liberty, equality, spiritual and political freedoms, to social, cultural, and economic rights. As of today, there are 192 member states of the United Nations, all of which have agreed to abide by the Declaration. The document has also been translated 467 times, setting a world record back in 2009 for the most translated document in the world.
