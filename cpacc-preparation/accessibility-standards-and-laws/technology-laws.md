# Technology and Domain-Specific Laws

In a broad sense, information technology law provides legal outlines and regulations for distributing, collecting, and storing electronic information. While there is no single law that can be called information technology law, there are a number of laws that concentrate on various aspects of technology, such as data protection and privacy, intellectual property, hardware and software, telecommunications, and the Internet. When it comes to technology and accessibility, there are several laws throughout the world that focus on technology accessibility requirements, particularly regarding the Internet.

## United States

### 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act (CVAA)

The CVAA requires "advanced communications services and products" to be accessible to people with disabilities, including video communications, text messaging, web browsers on mobile devices, and other similar technologies. Perhaps of greater significance to web developers, all video programs presented with captions on television must be presented with closed-captions on the internet. As it is written, the CVAA does not explicitly apply to web-only videos, but the video captioning requirement in WCAG applies to videos of all kinds on the internet, whether broadcast on television or not.

#### The CVAA applies to:

All entities already covered by FCC regulations (namely: telecommunication hardware and software providers and television broadcasters and television hardware/software providers)

#### The CVAA is enforced by:

- Consumers (people with disabilities) filing formal complaints

### Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA)

The ACAA of 1986 prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in air travel and requires air carriers to accommodate the needs of passengers with disabilities. In March 1990, the Department of Transportation (DoT) issued a rule defining the rights of passengers and the obligations of air carriers as a direct result of this law. On November 12, 2013 the DoT issued rule ([DOT-OST-2011-0177-0111](https://www.regulations.gov/document/DOT-OST-2011-0177-0111)) regarding the accessibility of carrier websites and ticket kiosks, which will require these sites and kiosks to be accessible to people with disabilities. The final rule published was published in the Federal Register ([FR Vol. 78 No. 218](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2013-11-12/pdf/2013-26749.pdf)) on November 12, 2013 and went into effect on December 12, 2013, thirty days after publication.

U.S. and foreign air carriers operating flights within or to the U.S. or selling tickets to the U.S. public are required to ensure that the public-facing content of websites that they own or control conforms to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Level AA. The requirements apply to both U.S. air carriers’ public-facing pages and foreign carriers’ public-facing pages that are used to advertise or sell to the U.S. public for air transportation that begins or ends in the U.S. The regulations apply to core air travel services as of December 12, 2015 and to the entire site as of December 12, 2016. Core air travel services are defined in 14 CFR 382.43 to include portions of the site related to seven core activities:

1. Booking or changing a reservation, including all flight amenities;
2. Checking in for a flight;
3. Accessing a personal travel itinerary;
4. Accessing the status of a flight;
5. Accessing a personal frequent flyer account;
6. Accessing flight schedules; and
7. Accessing carrier contact information.

By implication, this also includes the general portions of the site users need to navigate through to access these services. In effect, this provides some degree of blanket coverage for making sites compliant that will be in effect as of the December 12, 2015 deadline.

#### The ACAA applies to:

- U.S. and foreign air carriers operating flights within or to the U.S. or selling tickets to the U.S. public

#### The ACAA is enforced by:

- Consumers (people with disabilities) filing formal complaints

- [Wikipedia entry about ACAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Carrier_Access_Act)

#### Note:
As of December 11, 2015, the U.S. Department of Transportation extended the deadline of the first phase of ACAA (accessibility of core travel services) to June 30, 2016.

### State Web Accessibility Laws

Many U.S. States have their own web accessibility laws, usually aimed at state and local government, which can include K-12 schools and universities.

## Canada

### Web Standards for the Government of Canada

The government of Canada has published web standards for accessibility, usability, interoperability, and mobile devices. These guidelines apply to the government, and do not apply explicitly to the private sector.

### Quebec: Standards sur l'accessibilité du Web

## Europe

### France

All French central government websites and public services are required to comply with the Référentiel Général d'Accessibilité pour les Administrations (RGAA), which is based on WCAG Level AA.

### Germany

Government websites must comply with Barrierefreie-Informationstechnik-Verordnung (BITV 2.0), which is based on of WCAG 2.1 Level AA.

Its reference to EN 301 549 has shown the German Federal Government’s commitment to achieving conformity level AA. One thing though, BITV 2.0 goes beyond WCAG 2.1 Level AA by mandating general explanations of content and navigation in German sign language and easy language, amongst other small differences in details.

### Netherlands

Under procurement legislation, all government websites must comply with WCAG 2.0 Level AA web accessibility guidelines.
