# Web Accessibility Principles

The [Web Accessibility Initiative](http://www.w3.org/WAI/) at the [World Wide Web Consortium](http://www.w3.org/) outlined four main web accessibility principles in the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/), version 2.0. In order to be accessible, web content must be Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust.

The first letters of these principles form an acronym — <strong>POUR</strong> — which may help you remember them.
