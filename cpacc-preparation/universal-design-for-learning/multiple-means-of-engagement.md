## Principle 3: Multiple Means of Engagement

Implementing different options for learner engagement is essential to the learning process. When learners can make personal connections to their education and assign significance to learning, it increases the chances of them internalizing the information. 

Since learners are diverse, especially when it comes to determining what is meaningful to them (think of their differing backgrounds and interests), instructors should not rely on a single means of engaging learners.

<strong>Principle 3: Multiple Means of Engagement</strong> recognizes the need for providing multiple ways to get learners involved in their education. Learners need to discover why learning is important. Some students may discover the reasons for learning through completing real-world tasks, research projects, and experiments; while other learners may be engaged in learning through lectures and discussion.

Some may be engaged through routines like daily pop quizzes; and some may discover the importance of educational goals through group activities.

There is no one way to ensure that all students are able to actively participate and find meaning in the learning process. Giving learners different opportunities to be actively involved and create their own learning experiences is necessary for success.

## Guidelines for Multiple Means of Engagement

### Guideline 7: Provide Options for Recruiting Interest

When a student is uninterested in information being presented to him or her, he or she is less likely to process that information. Information that is uninteresting to a student becomes inaccessible to that student.

Learners are incredibly diverse in their interests and their interests may also change over time. Instructors should focus on highlighting these differences in learners by including multiple ways for recruiting and promoting their interests.

#### Checkpoints for Guideline 7

##### Checkpoint 7.1: Promote Individual Choice and Autonomy

One way instructors can involve students in their learning experiences is to encourage them to choose how they will achieve instructional objectives. Providing options for learners and allowing them to pick what is best for them to meet objectives makes them feel more connected to their education.

Teachers should consider letting students choose how they will be assessed for particular activities, what tools and resources to use for research, and choose rewards they can attain in the classroom environment. Support individual choice and autonomy.

##### Checkpoint 7.2: Emphasize Relevance, Value, and Authenticity

When learners do not see the value in information or know how the information relates to them, they tend to lose interest pretty quickly. To recruit interest, teachers should emphasize relevance and help learners connect to topics through authentic assessments and activities.

Students vary greatly in their interests, so incorporating variety in these activities is essential. Helping students make personal connections to information and inviting them to participate and reflect on their learning can enable them to see the value in their education.

##### Checkpoint 7.3: Reduce Threats and Distractions

Learners can concentrate better on their education when they know that their classroom environment is safe. Threats and distractions in the classroom can have a negative impact on the learning process. Instructors should aim to minimize threats and distractions, keeping in mind that threats and distractions vary from student to student.

Some students may be sensitive to sensory stimuli like flashing lights or video containing too much motion. Other students may find unexpected activities or changes in routine troubling. Teachers should maintain a safe and supportive classroom. Prepare students for activities through a daily calendar and ready them for challenges they may face while completing certain tasks. Vary activities that may stimulate certain senses and allow students to take brief breaks or timeouts if necessary.

### Guideline 8: Provide Options for Sustaining Effort and Persistence

For learning to take place, students are required to pay attention and put forth effort during the learning process. When students are motivated to learn, that motivation betters their chances of fully concentrating on what they need to learn. Learner diversity applies here, too.

Attention spans are different for each learner. Teachers should aim to develop and improve attention and concentration skills in their students. They should also bring various options into the classroom environment that stimulate motivation and self-regulation.

#### Checkpoints for Guideline 8

##### Checkpoint 8.1: Reiterate Goals and Objectives

While completing certain tasks or lengthy activities, learners may forget the purpose behind those tasks or activities. It is important to remind students of the goals and objectives they will achieve. Keep them motivated by stressing the value of learning activities. Students may benefit from seeing or hearing the goal reiterated in different ways. 

Facilitate a discussion with students about goals and objectives and encourage them to find meaning in them. Encourage them to connect goal and objectives to their own personal interests. Have learners restate the goal in their own words and reflect on what attaining that goal means to them.

##### Checkpoint 8.2: Vary Learning Challenges

Every learner should be challenged to make learning effective, but not every learner is challenged by the same type of activity or assessment. The levels of difficulty for completing tasks should be varied.

Additionally, instructors should supply the resources needed to complete activities in the classroom environment so that students can successfully complete tasks. When options are presented to learners, they can discover what motivates them to learn.

##### Checkpoint 8.3: Promote Collaboration and Communication

Communication and collaboration are skills that learners will need well beyond the classroom. It is crucial that instructors implement activities that enable learners to collaborate with each other and achieve goals together. 

Students coming together and supporting each other during the learning process can significantly be engaging experiences for them. Peer assessments, group activities, peer tutors, and programs that bring learners together with common interests are all ways to foster communication and collaboration in the learning environment.

##### Checkpoint 8.4: Give Mastery-Oriented Feedback Often

Instructors can engage learners through providing specific, constructive feedback on assessments. Teachers should go beyond showing students what was “right or wrong” on assessments and give detailed, relevant feedback that learners can actually use to improve their performance to master topics.

Frequent feedback should also be provided so that students are encouraged to perform better throughout the learning process.

### Guideline 9: Provide Options for Self-Regulation

Teaching students how to react appropriately to learning environments tends to go unaddressed when designing curricula. It is expected that learners acquire this kind of emotional self-regulation on their own.

While some students are able to manage their emotions and ability to cope in the classroom, there are some students who may not know exactly how self-regulation skills should be developed.

As a result, learning how to manage emotions becomes inaccessible to these students. As emphasized all throughout UDL, learners' reactions to their environment and to what they are learning differ from student to student. The key for teachers is to provide assorted options that support learners in effectively managing their reactions to the learning process.

#### Checkpoints for Guideline 9

##### Checkpoint 9.1: Use Belief to Increase Motivation

Learners need to be able to set realistic and personal academic goals for themselves, and believe that they can achieve those goals. Setting goals and believing in attaining those goals result in students further discovering motivation for learning. The path to achieving goals can be frustrating for some students, so it is important that they learn how to cope during those difficult times. 

Teachers should incorporate multiple options that help students manage goal-setting, achieve goals, and stay motivated while trying to achieve those goals. Rubrics, checklists, study guides, and calendars can be used to help students have confidence in managing their goals. Additionally, utilizing self-reflection activities can help learners identify what they found motivating while trying to achieve goals.

##### Checkpoint 9.2: Help Strengthen Coping Skills and Strategies

Though checklists, rubrics, and study guides can be used to help students cope during the learning process, teachers need to ensure they consistently include methods that help students manage their emotional responses.

Learners differ in how they react to certain settings or tasks, so instructors will need to include a variety of strategies that help students cope with stressful situations. 

In addition to the examples mentioned in Checkpoint 9.1, teachers can provide feedback to students for how to handle their frustrations and learning phobias. They can also use models and real-life examples that demonstrate coping skills to students.

##### Checkpoint 9.3: Nurture Self-Assessment and Reflection

Learners quickly lose motivation when they are unable to observe their own progress toward a goal. Instructors can include a variety of self-assessments to assist learners in seeing their progression. 

Though students can observe progress through timely and constructive feedback, they can also use tools like aids, charts, portfolios, and templates to collect information about their academic behavior. These tools allow them to see how they have progressed in their education.

Activities that allow students to assess their own work can also allow them to see how far they have come along in their learning experiences.
