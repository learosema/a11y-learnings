# Why Certify?

    "Certification is an important step forward for the accessibility profession. It defines a baseline of knowledge for accessibility professionals and provides a meaningful target for university programs, corporate training, and professional development. Most important of all, certification elevates our expectations for a more inclusive world, empowering people with disabilities by creating environments that welcome them, rather than exclude them,"

Paul Bohman, PhD, IAAP Certification Committee Chair.

## Benefits for Individuals Who Certify

Passing the certification exam means that you have achieved a certain level of expertise within the accessibility field. It's a way to prove to yourself and to others that you know enough to qualify as an accessibility professional. You'll be able to refer to your certification on your resume, in your title (e.g. John Smith, CPACC), in job applications, and anywhere else where credentials can be beneficial.

You'll stand out from other job applicants who are not certified, giving you a better chance to get the job you want.

## Benefits for Organizations that Encourage Certification

Businesses and organizations demonstrate their commitment to accessibility when they encourage their employees to get IAAP-certified. Employees understand that it is a priority, and that accessibility expertise is valued within the organization. Employees will be motivated to learn more about accessibility and to incorporate accessibility techniques into their skill set.

Having a team of certified employees gives companies an expanded list of talented people who can do accessibility right. Too often, accessibility is treated as a side project with no real connection to the core functions of the company. The reality is that accessibility has to become a way of doing things all the time, not just a temporary project to do once and forget.

When hiring, if companies state in the job description that they are looking for IAAP-certified accessibility talent, they're much more likely to get qualified applicants with a consistent and predictable skill set.

## Benefits for the Accessibility Profession

As more people receive IAAP certification, the industry will start to pay more attention to the need for accessibility. Certification is a way to further legitimize accessibility expertise as a skill set worth having. More full-time accessibility jobs will appear in the marketplace, with titles like Chief Accessibility Officer, Accessibility Director, Accessibility Specialist, and Accessibility Trainer. These titles already exist, and will become more common, giving accessibility professionals a greater variety of job opportunities.

Certification also helps define what it means to be an accessibility professional. It defines a common core of knowledge that professionals should have, as a minimum. Over time, if a large number of people have this core knowledge, accessibility will be commonplace and expected as a way of approaching design.

## Benefits for People with Disabilities

The real goal is to make the world more accessible to people with disabilities. Certification moves us closer to that ultimate goal.
