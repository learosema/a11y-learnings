# Guidelines

## Introduction:

The internationally-recognized [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/), published by the [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](http://www.w3.org/), are the most authoritative source for defining web accessibility. The W3C also published the [Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/), for applications and software that create web content.
