## European Union

### EN 301 549: "Accessibility requirements suitable for public procurement of ICT products and services in Europe"

- similar to Section 508 in the US
- Like Section 508, EN 301 549 covers a variety of technologies, not just the web.
- Portions that deal with the web refer to WCAG level AA.

Something else that remains to be seen is how European countries will implement this law. The original mandate was to create a set of guidelines for use in public procurement of ICT, meaning ICT used in government and other tax-supported entities. The private sector was not part of the original mandate. Some countries may limit the scope of EN 301 549 to the public sector, as originally intended, but the door has been left open to allow a broader interpretation. Other countries may decide to apply EN 301 549 to both public and private sectors.
