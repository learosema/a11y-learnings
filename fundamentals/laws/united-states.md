## The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)

The ADA is a broad civil rights law that prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in employment, architectural design, transportation, examinations and courses, and other services offering "public accommodation." Even though the ADA says nothing about web accessibility explicitly, many of the web accessibility lawsuits in the United States invoke the ADA as the basis for the legal complaint, because of the language about "public accommodation."

### Applies to

- private entities that own, operate, lease public accomodation
- federal and state government entities

### Enforced by

- People with disabilities filing formal complaints

## 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act (CVAA)

The CVAA requires "advanced communications services and products" to be accessible to people with disabilities, including video communications, text messaging, web browsers on mobile devices, and other similar technologies. Perhaps of greater significance to web developers, all video programs presented with captions on television must be presented with closed-captions on the internet. As it is written, the CVAA does not explicitly apply to web-only videos, but the video captioning requirement in WCAG applies to videos of all kinds on the internet, whether broadcast on television or not.

### Applies to

- All entities already covered by FCC regulations (namely: telecommunication hardware and software providers and television broadcasters and television hardware/software providers)

### Enforced by

- People with disabilities filing formal complaints
