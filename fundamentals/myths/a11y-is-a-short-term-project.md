# Myth: Accessibility is a short-term project

## Truth: Accessibility is an ongoing design requirement

Accessibility is not going away. As long as there are people, there will be a need for accessible design.

You can compare accessibility to other focus areas like security or privacy. Those needs will never disappear or be phased out. They are ongoing requirements in all stages of development and QA.

## Accessibility must be embedded into the process

A11y needs to be part of the process from start to finish

- Business requirements
- Design requirements
- QA requirements and test cases
- Training of new employees
- Ongoing training and professional development for current employees
- Software to detect accessibility flaws

## The company culture must commit to a11y

- All must commit to a11y, including leaders
- In the absence of this kind of leadership, there may be a few people or departments within the company that may commit to a11y, but an incomplete approach will always produce incomplete results.
- The organization is only as strong as the weakest link in the chain.

## Commit resources and full-time jobs to a11y

- hire people who specialize in accessibility, and give them enough authority within the company to make a real difference.

## Hiring people with disabilities can be immensely helpful

- Working together on a daily basis with people with disabilities is one of the most powerful ways to ensure a11y
- Hiring people with disabilities requires a concerted effort in the HR process.
- Be willing to commit to inclusive hiring practices as a long-term strategy.
