# Myth: Accessibility benefits only a small minority

## Truth: A11y benefits a wide variety of people

- a11y principles benefit everyone
- same principles that make a web site good for people with disabilities also make it good for people on mobile devices

### Anyone can acquire a disability

- If you don't have a disability now, chances are that you'll acquire one eventually, assuming that you live to an old age. People tend to lose physical abilities as they age, in all categories: vision, hearing, mobility, cognition, and so on.

### Disabilities are a sizeable minority

- Don't dismiss a group of people just because they're a minority.
- Accessibility is necessary and non-negotiable.
- Without accessibility, people with disabilities can't use web sites, and that can have a dramatically negative impact in their lives.
