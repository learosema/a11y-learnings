# Summary

## The goal is to use accessibility to drive innovation

There are real challenges to solve in accessibility. Let those challenges drive innovation. Let them be the inspiration that lifts the design to the next level. Don't be satisfied with "good enough" or compliant. Think creatively. Think inclusively. Always design with accessibility in mind.

## Accessibility matters a lot to people with disabilities

Compliance does not equate to a great user experience; your creativity and commitment to accessibility will be the deciding factor in how we raise the bar for what customers expect when using our products and services.

Inaccessible web sites are not just inconvenient for people with disabilities, they are blocking. You have the power to make your product better by making it usable by all people and giving everyone equal access to information.

Failing to make a web site accessible has real consequences for real people. Inaccessible web sites take away freedoms that people with disabilities would otherwise enjoy, reducing quality of life, and making day-to-day tasks difficult or impossible. Let's do our part to design a more inclusive and more welcoming experience for all our customers.
