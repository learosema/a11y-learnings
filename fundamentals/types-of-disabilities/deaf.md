# Deafness

## Web a11y for deafness

- Most of the web is accessible to people with auditory disabilities
- Main concern with deafness is the a11y of audio, either in audio-only or video+audio formats
- for pre-recorded audio-only files, provide a transcript, including all of the narration and other important sounds
- Videos usually contain audio synchronized with the video itself. Provide live captions. A transcript alone is not sufficient as it's difficult to line up with the video.

## Provide Synchronized Captions plus a Transcript

- additionally providing a transcript can be helpful for people who cannot read quickly
- if a person is deaf and blind, neither the video nor the audio is accessible to them, but a text can be converted into braille via screen reader

## Design Considerations for deafness

- All videos must have captions
- All audio-only content must have transcripts
- Sign language interpretation of videos can be helpful
