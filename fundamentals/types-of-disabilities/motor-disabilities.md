## Assistive Technologies used by people with motor disabilities

- Vertical keyboard with mouse stick
- One-handed keyboard
- Expanded keyboard with raised sections between keys
- Speech recognition

## Design considerations for motor disabilities

- All functionality must be available only using the keyboard
- links, buttons and controls must have a visible `:focus` state and should have a visible `:hover` state
- With session time-outs, warn users before the time expires and give them the option to extend the session. Ensure the warning itself allows for slow responses. A recommended minimum response time is 2 minutes
- Provide large click targets (links, buttons, controls)
