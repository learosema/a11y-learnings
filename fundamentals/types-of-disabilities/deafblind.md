# Deafblind

- For people who are deaf and blind, the only option for interacting with a computer is a refreshable braille display
- The screen reader displays text via the braille display instead of reading out loud
- Braille displays have a line of holes in the physical interface that allow small pins to come up to form braille chars
- The screen reader sends the text per line to the braille display, users can read on that line and press a button to go to the next line
