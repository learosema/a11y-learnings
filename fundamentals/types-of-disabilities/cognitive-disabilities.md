## Web a11y for cognitive disabilities

### Limited comprehension

Most people with cognitive disabilities experience limited comprehension of one kind or another. They may not be able to understand complex ideas. They may have difficulty with metaphors or abstract language.

### Low tolerance for cognitive overload

Some people with cognitive disabilities easily become frustrated or upset when they sense difficult situations, or when there are too many things in their environment happening at the same time.

### Limited problem-solving skills

When presented with a problem to solve, some people with cognitive disabilites may be unable to solve it. Example: CAPTCHA

### Attention Deficit

Some users experience attention deficits, making it hard for them to focus on the task at hand. They may get lost in their own thoughts, or they may find online advertisements too interesting, causing them to forget why they went to the website in the first place.

### Difficulty reading

Many people with cognitive disabilities experience difficulty reading. Some read at a lower level than their peers of the same age, and some can't read at all. It can help to provide illustrations or audio to supplement text.

### Difficulty understanding or using math

Some people experience math anxiety, which is an emotional or psychological fear that grips some people when confronted with math problems. This is less of an intellectual deficit than a psychological deficit. Other people truly cannot solve mathematical problems because their brains are not capable of that kind of thinking.

## Design considerations for Cognitive Disabilities

For users with lower comprehension:

- simplify the interface as much as possible
- simplify the content as much as possible
- keep videos and audio as short as possible
- limit the number of choices on the screen
- provide help features
- design for ease of use
- test the usability of the interface with actual users, preferably including users with cognitive disabilities

For users with memory loss:

- Retain information accross screens, and within a path
- provide help features

For users with distractability

- Reduce or eliminate distractions (be careful with ads, carousels, intrusive audio/video)
