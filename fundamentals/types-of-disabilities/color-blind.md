## Types of color-blindness

- Most common is red-green color-blindness (two common subtypes are Deuteranopia and Protanopia)
- Some people have blue-yellow color-blindness (Tritanopia)
- Very rare, insensitivity to all colors (people with Achromatopsia see colors in grayscale)
- Red and black color-blindness
