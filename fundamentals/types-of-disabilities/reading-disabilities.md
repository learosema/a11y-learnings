# Difficulty Reading

Some experience difficulty reading. Some read at a lower level than their peers of the same age, some can't read at all.

It can help to provide illustrations or audio to supplement text.

Some people with dyslexia have high levels of cognitive functioning at a conceptual level, but visual encoding of text can be difficult, so they have a hard time spelling or reading words.

## Design considerations for Reading Disabilities

- Supplement text with illustrations, videos or audio
- Avoid the highest level of contrast (black/white) but be sure to stay within the contrast range that people with low vision need
