# Accessibility Fundamentals: Disabilities, Guidelines, and Laws

## Introduction

### Accessibility is Freedom

The web has the potential to bring an unprecedented level of independence to people with disabilities. People with disabilities who cannot easily leave the house, or who may encounter barriers outside the home, can perform tasks from their computer like shopping, banking, working, and even watching entertainment or playing games. But that's only if the web sites are built with accessibility in mind.

Accessibility does not happen by accident. It has to be purposefully planned, built, and tested for accessibility. Inaccessible web sites deprive users with disabilities of experiences and opportunities that other people take for granted, and they put companies at legal risk for discrimination lawsuits.

This module explores the needs of people with disabilities and provides important background information about accessibility guidelines, laws, and rationale.
