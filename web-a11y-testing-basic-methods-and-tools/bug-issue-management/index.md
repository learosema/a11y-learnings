# Bug/Issue Management

## Introduction:

As testing is conducted, testers are expected to report the nature of each accessibility issue found, recommendations for fixing the issue, and the impact it has on users. It is critical to describe accessibility issues in terms most people who aren't accessibility experts can understand and to provide clear recommendations for fixing these problems. Sometimes, accessibility testers are also required to provide a measure of impact for those issues. Keeping all of this in mind, this section provides guidance on how to create effective and actionable bug reports for accessibility issues.
