# Role-based Checklists

There is not just one role that is responsible for accessibility; there are many roles that play a part in ensuring that web content is accessible. If you are a designer, developer, tester, or have a combined role, the checklists below provide guidance for how these different roles contribute to creating an accessible web site. Directors and program managers are also encouraged to review these checklists and become familiar with these checklists to understand how those within their teams can contribute to furthering accessibility in specific projects.
