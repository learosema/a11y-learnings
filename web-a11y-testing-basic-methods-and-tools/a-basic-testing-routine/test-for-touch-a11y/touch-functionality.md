# Touch Functionality

## Overview

Similar to all functionality being available through keyboard, all functionality on a web page must be available through touch. The funny thing is that touch functionality and mouse functionality are very similar. Touch devices rely on mouse click events to function.

So, basically, if a web page is accessible by mouse, it is generally accessible by touch. Touch functionality is affected when functionality is only available through keystrokes.

It is also affected when functionality relies on gestures or drag and drop operations. Because of the differences between operating systems and versions on mobile devices, gestures and drag and drop may not always be supported. Click functionality is key for touch functionality.

## Testing Methodology for Touch Functionality

Using a mobile device or other device that allows for touch:

Check that all functionality is available through touch such as activating links, buttons, and interacting with menus and custom widgets (tab panels, carousels, media players, etc.).

### Note:

- Use native `<button>` elements wherever possible
