# Keyboard Traps

## Overview

Keyboard-only users may sometimes navigate into areas in a web page that can only be escaped by using a mouse or some other input method that is unavailable to them.

When these users encounter a keyboard trap, it seriously hinders the usability of the page. It is critical that users can easily move into and move out of areas of a web page by keyboard alone.

## Testing Methodology for Keyboard Traps

When testing for keyboard traps, it is important to be sure you can navigate forward and backward through the page content without having to use a device other than the keyboard.

To test for keyboard traps:

- Navigate into the web page from the URL field using only the Tab key.
- As you tab through elements on the web page, be cognizant of any difficulties you encounter. You should be able to tab repeatedly through all focusable elements such as links, form controls, and menu items.
- For custom widgets, you should be able to tab to the widget and use the arrow keys to navigate within the widget. You should also be able to tab out of the widget.
- Use Shift + Tab to navigate the web page in reverse. Make sure you can tab backwards easily without the keyboard focus getting trapped.
