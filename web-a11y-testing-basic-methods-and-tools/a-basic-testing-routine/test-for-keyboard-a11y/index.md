# Test for Keyboard Accessibility

A good place to begin manual testing is by first evaluating input methods. This section presents all of the testing methodologies used in evaluating keyboard accessibility.

While the main focus of the A Basic Testing Routine section is the testing phase of the development cycle, developers are encouraged to test for keyboard accessibility during the build/creation phase as they write code and create web content to catch as many device-dependent instances as possible before their code is evaluated in the testing phase.
