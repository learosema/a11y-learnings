# Automated Testing Tools

## Introduction:

When it comes to automated tools, a lot of options exist. These tools are not all equal, and there is a tradeoff between leveraging the capabilities of a powerful tool and one that is simpler to use but has fewer features. And different tools may be used at different times.

Basic tools test one page at a time using a defined set of rules. Some may even test for only one very narrowly defined type of error. At the other end of the spectrum, there are enterprise-level automated testing tools that use spiders to crawl and analyze multiple pages and have the ability to select a custom set of checking rules, record scripts, automatically fill out forms, schedule repeat tests, automate reports, and much more.
