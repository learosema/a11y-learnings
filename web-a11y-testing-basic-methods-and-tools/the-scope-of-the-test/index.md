# The Scope of the Test

## Introduction:

The first thing to do when beginning a web accessibility evaluation is determine what the scope of that evaluation will be:

- Are a few pages going to be evaluated, or an entire web application?
- Will the evaluation stick to informational content or will it also cover transactional processes?
- Which pages are going to be evaluated?
- How can the best pages be selected to get the most out of the evaluation process?

All these questions and more need to be answered before the evaluation begins. The main goal here is to select a sample of pages that will be significantly representative of the entire site or application.

Usually, all of the pages on the website do not have to be tested as long as the pages selected are representative of the entire site. However, how big the sample needs to be will vary from just a few to several dozens or hundreds, depending on the size of the website and the budget.
