# Summary

Testing for accessibility is valuable in ensuring that users with disabilities can effectively use your websites. Throughout this module, you have learned:

- Accessibility testing plays a key part throughout the entire development life cycle:
  - Tests should be written during the planning phase based on accessibility requirements.
  - Developers should conduct automated tests, keyboard accessibility tests, and screen reader testing of custom widgets during the build/creation phase.
  - Comprehensive manual testing and QA should be performed to identify accessibility issues missed during the previous phases of development.
- Everyone has a role in creating accessible web content.
- A methodology should be established in order for the testing process to be effective, such as:
  - Define the scope of the evaluation
  - Conduct automated tests and manual tests
  - Document all findings in a detailed report
  - Plan for remediation based on findings from tests
  - Conduct regression testing to evaluate fixes
  - aXe can be used for automated testing.
- Manual testing needs to be conducted to validate automated tests and to discover issues that automated tests cannot identify.
- Reports for accessibility issues need to be composed in a format that allows designers, developers, and other stakeholders to successfully address accessibility issues.
- Issues should be prioritized based on factors like business value, risk, visibility of issues, and severity of issues.
- Regression testing and monitoring should be conducted to identify issues that may emerge from previous remediation efforts.

The more you know about accessibility, the easier it will be to test and evaluate content for accessibility. Learn more about accessibility by exploring other modules in this web accessibility curriculum.
