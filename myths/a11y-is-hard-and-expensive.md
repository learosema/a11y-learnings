# Myth: Accessibility is hard and expensive

## Truth: The cost is reasonable when compared to the cost of the alternatives

### Maintaining an accessible system is cost effective

- Creating an accessible system does cost money, but failing to do so costs more in the end
- start with a11y in mind, so you can incorporate accessible design into every step of the project
- all these extra considerations for a11y cost money but having to retrofit an inaccessible system costs more

### Lawsuits are expensive

- If your company is served a lawsuit, the cost of fighting can be high

### Negative publicity is expensive

Having your company's name in the news for failing to meet the needs of people with disabilities is the kind of publicity that is best to avoid.
