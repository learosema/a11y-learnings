# Myth: Accessibility should be the last step

Thinking that a11y is something that can be fixed after the "main development" is done is an anti-pattern.

## Truth: Design for A11y from start is much easier

- A last-minute bolted-on approach usually results in a bad design, and a bad user experience
- Adding accessibility at the end can be difficult
- Accessibility might never get done at all
- The cycle is self-perpetuating
- A last-minute approach exposes systematic neglect
- Poor planning is a legal liability

## Design with accessibility in mind from the beginning.

It takes a little bit of extra forethought and planning, but it saves you a lot of work down the road.
