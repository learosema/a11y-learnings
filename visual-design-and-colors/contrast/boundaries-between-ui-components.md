# Boundaries between UI components

## Whenever visual boundaries are used to distinguish controls, the contrast of UI control boundaries compared to adjacent areas MUST be at least 3 to 1 to distinguish the UI control from the adjacent areas.

People who have low vision and color vision deficiencies may be unable to see user interface elements if they don't have sufficient contrast against their adjacent areas. 

It's important to consider providing visual feedback to sighted users by increasing the contrast of UI elements and their surrounding areas. When the contrast for UI elements is enhanced, it makes interacting with these elements on a screen much less difficult for these users.

### Note

In the case of developing for iOS, try to always use the standard iOS colors or always check that custom color combinations have sufficient contrast.
