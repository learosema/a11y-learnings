# Contrast

## Introduction

Among commonly overlooked accessibility issues are those of color and contrast. There are nearly three times more individuals with low vision than those with total blindness. A person who cannot see will not know which to choose when instructed to "advance to next screen using the red arrow."

One person in twelve has some sort of color deficiencyâ€”about 8% of men and 0.4% of women in the U.S. A person with low vision or color blindness will not be able to distinguish text against a background without sufficient contrast.
