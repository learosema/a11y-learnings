# Text against the background

## Small text (under 18 point regular font or 14 point bold font) MUST have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5 to 1 with the background.

Ensuring that there's enough color contrast between text and background makes content easier to read for people with low vision. Low vision users may not necessarily need to use contrast-enhancing assistive technologies if the contrast of the text and background is 4.5 to 1.

The rule also considers people who have color vision deficiencies. Some color vision deficits may affect how bright colors appear to someone, so this rule also helps ensure that color doesn't affect how these users perceive content on the screen.

Backgrounds may consist of a solid color, a pattern, a gradient, an image, an animation, a video, or other element. It also may change over time, as the user scrolls, or as the size of the viewport changes. 

The contrast minimum should meet this standard under all of these conditions unless the poor contrast is so brief (e.g. a second or less) as to not significantly interfere with the user experience.

Bad Example: Low Contrast Between Text and Background

## Small text (under 18 point regular font or 14 point bold font) SHOULD have a contrast ratio of at least 7 to 1 with the background.

Consider increasing the color contrast beyond the minimum requirements for mobile applications. Due to the smaller viewport size and varying environmental conditions that devices are used in, enhanced contrast will make an app the most accessible to the widest number of users.

A contrast ratio of 7:1 can compensate the contrast loss for people whose vision is about 20/80 or those with color vision deficiencies. These users typically don't need to use contrast-enhancing assistive technologies, but they may have difficulty seeing contrast that is 4.5:1, especially on mobile devices.

## Large text and images of large text (at or over 18 point or 14 point bold) MUST have a contrast ratio of at least 3 to 1 with the background.

Generally, text that is 18 point or 14 point bold has wider strokes that makes it easier to read at a lower contrast. So, the contrast rule for large text is lower.

The point sizes for this rule are based on CSS point size. So, 1 point equals 1.333 CSS pixels. So, 18 point font is 24 pixels and 14 point font is 18.5 pixels.

Backgrounds may consist of a solid color, a pattern, a gradient, an image, an animation, a video, or other element. It also may change over time, as the user scrolls, or as the size of the viewport changes. 

The contrast minimum should meet this standard under all of these conditions unless the poor contrast is so brief (e.g. a second or less) as to not significantly interfere with the user experience.
