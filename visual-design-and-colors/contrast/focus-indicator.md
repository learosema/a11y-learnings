# Focus indicator

## The contrast of all visual focus indicators against the background MUST be at least 3 to 1.

In some browsers, the default styling for the visual focus indicator (the thin dotted outline around focused elements) may be difficult to see, especially for users who have low vision. 

Enhancing the visual focus indicator will make it easier for users to see what element on a web page has keyboard focus among all the other elements on the web page. Being able to detect the visual focus right away will increase the efficiency of using and interacting with the page.
