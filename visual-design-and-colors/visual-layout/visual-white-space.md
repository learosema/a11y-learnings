# Visual "White Space"

## Blocks of content SHOULD be visually separated and distinct from each other, via margins, padding, or other methods of achieving visual "white space."

Content elements such as paragraphs, images, columns, sidebars, table borders and cells, etc. are easier to read and understand when they are visually distinct. If they are too close in proximity to each other, it can be hard to tell where one element begins and another ends, especially if they have similar visual styling.

Even if two elements don't blur or blend together, if the text is very close to the edge of another element (like the borders on a table cell, or the background color of an adjacent side bar), the text is harder to read.
