# Allowing customizability

## Visible text SHOULD be standard text in the markup (not images or graphic versions of text), to allow user customization of text color and contrast.

While accessibility guidelines require a minimum contrast ratio between text and its background, some people are sensitive to brightness and need to change the colors. The use of real text instead of images of text allows users to adjust text and background color and contrast.

- good: put text into the markup
- bad: use text inside images and not in the markup 

## Visible UI components SHOULD use native controls and features (not images or graphic versions of controls) where available, to allow user customization of interface color and contrast.

While accessibility guidelines require a minimum contrast ratio between text and its background, some people are sensitive to brightness and need to change the colors. The use of real text instead of images of text allows users to adjust text and background color and contrast.

- good: use CSS to style a button
- bad: use an image as a button
