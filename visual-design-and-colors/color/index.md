# Color

## Introduction

Color is a great way to enhance the visual appeal of our web content, but we must ensure that color is not the only way information is conveyed. 

Information, in this context, includes emphasizing text, distinguishing between visual elements, and distinguishing interactive elements from static elements. People who are colorblind, have low vision or are blind must also have access to information conveyed by color.

We also need to be mindful that the color choices we make for our web content may actually be disabling for some people. Some people may also experience pain when looking at bright lights or bright areas on paper or computer screens. All-white backgrounds can be particularly difficult.

To attempt to remedy the effects of low contrast and bright areas, users may modify the colors either in the operating system or in the web browser. To accommodate the needs of all, we must design and develop our content to remain customizable according to individual needs.

In no way do we discourage the use of color in web design, but it is crucial to not use color alone to convey important information since users may customize colors based on what is best for them. Make sure the important information is represented in the text.
