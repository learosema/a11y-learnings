# Color to Distinguish Links from Text

## Color alone MUST NOT be used to distinguish links from surrounding text unless the color contrast between the link and the surrounding text is at least 3:1 and an additional differentiation (e.g. underline, outline, etc.) is provided when the link is hovered or receives focus.

Sighted users must be able to tell the difference visually between links and text. If they can't tell the difference, they won't know what items are clickable, and they may miss important links. 

There is no need to change the default styling to meet accessibility best practices.

There are a few common ways to distinguish between links and text:

### Option 1: Different color plus underline:

This is the default styling in browsers.

### Option 2: Different color plus underline the links only on hover and focus:

Some designers don't like the look of underlined links, so they remove the underline from the styling. Removing the underline is not recommended for links in the main content area of a document, because people with low vision may not be able to distinguish the color of the text from the color of the links before hovering over them with a mouse or tabbing to them with a keyboard. 

Still, this technique can be allowable (though discouraged) if there is a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 between linked text and non-linked text, and as long as the underline becomes visible on keyboard focus (when users tab to the link) as well as on hover (when users place the mouse over the link).

### Option 3: Different background color on hover and focus:

This technique can be used in combination with adding an underline on hover and focus.

### Option 4: Add an outline or border on hover and focus:

This technique can be used in combination with adding an underline and/or background color change on hover and focus.

### Option 5: Placement in a navigation menu:

Sighted users will understand that items are clickable menu items if the menu itself is styled in a way that makes it obvious it is a navigation menu. 

This method is somewhat difficult to pin down in terms of what it means, because there are many ways to design a navigation menu, all of which can look like navigation menus, and design trends change over time, so future navigation menus may look different from today's navigation menus.

The short version is this: if it looks like a navigation menu, the links are sufficiently distinguished from the surrounding text, and there is no need to underline the links.
