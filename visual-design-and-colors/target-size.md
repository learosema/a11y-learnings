# Target Size

## The touch target size of actionable elements SHOULD be at least 44 pixels by 44 pixels with at least six pixels of inactive space between any adjacent actionable elements.

Small targets can be difficult to click or touch. The W3C recommends a minimum target size of 44 x 44 px to ensure that users are able to activate them. They also suggest that frequently used targets be made larger. 

The exceptions in this rule allow a target to be smaller than 44 px if another target that does the same thing on the same page meets the requirements, if the user gets to modify the target size themselves, or if the target is included inline in text, such as a footnote link, or if the target is required to be a specific size and changing it would affect the information or functionality.
