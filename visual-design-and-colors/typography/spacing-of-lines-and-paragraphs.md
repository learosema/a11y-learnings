# Spacing of the Lines and Paragraphs

## Line spacing SHOULD be at least 1.5 within paragraphs.

People with some reading disabilities or cognitive disabilities find it difficult to track text where the lines are close together. Providing extra space between lines allows them to better track the next line.

Note: Under most circumstances, line spacing should not exceed 2.0.

## Paragraph spacing SHOULD be at least 1.5 times larger than the line spacing.

The purpose of paragraphs is to organize a group of sentences into a cohesive unit. Adding visual cues to help distinguish between paragraphs helps to reinforce the concept of a paragraph as a cohesive unit, separate from the preceding and following paragraphs.

In the print world, indenting the first line of a paragraph is usually the convention for differentiating between paragraphs. This can be acceptable on the web too, but the convention on the web is usually to provide spacing above and below paragraphs, rather than to indent the first line.

Note: Under most circumstances, the spacing between paragraphs should not exceed 2.0 times larger than the line spacing.
