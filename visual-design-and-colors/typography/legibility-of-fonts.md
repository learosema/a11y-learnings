# Legibility of fonts

## Fonts SHOULD be easily readable by sighted users.

Which fonts are easiest to read? Are there any fonts that work better for users with reading disorders? Some research has been done in this area, and we can say one thing with absolute certainty: avoid fancy fonts. Specialty fonts with cursive or unusual shapes or artistic features may look pretty, but they are harder to read than standard fonts like Times New Roman or Arial.

- Good: standard fonts
- Bad: fancy fons (especially with cusive or unusual shapes or artistic features)
