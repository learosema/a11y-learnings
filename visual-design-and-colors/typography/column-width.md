# Column width

## The number of characters or glyphs per line in any section or column of text SHOULD NOT exceed 80 (40 characters in Chinese, Japanese, or Korean)

For people with some reading or vision disabilities, long lines of text can become a significant barrier. They have trouble keeping their place and following the flow of text. Having a narrow block of text (not exceeding 80 characters or glyphs) makes it easier for them to continue on to the next line in a block.

There are two ways to accomplish the objective of providing narrow column widths:

- Ensure that the text on your website reflows as the user narrows the viewing window, so the user can set the column widths to a size that is comfortable for them.
- Use relative CSS measurements to set column widths that average 80 characters or less as the user resizes the browser.
