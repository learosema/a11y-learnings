# Line justification

## Text SHOULD NOT be full justified.

People with certain reading disabilities or cognitive disabilities have problems reading text that is both left and right justified. 

The uneven spacing between words in fully justified text can cause "rivers of white space" to run down the page making reading difficult and, in some cases, impossible. 

Text justification can also cause words to be either bunched closely together or stretched in unnatural ways, so that it is difficult for them to locate word boundaries.
