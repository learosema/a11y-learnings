# Typography

## Introduction

People with some cognitive, language and learning disabilities and some low vision users cannot perceive the text and/or lose their reading place if the text is presented in a manner that is difficult for them to read. 

The guidelines presented in this section are intended to ensure that visually rendered text is presented in such a manner that it can be perceived without its layout interfering with its readability.

The typographical recommendations align with Level AAA WCAG requirements. They are considered best practices if your goal is to meet Level A and Level AA compliance standards.
