# Visual Design and Colors

## Summary

Visual content must be presented so that is it perceivable and understandable by people of differing abilities, including people who are color blind or have low vision, or people who have cognitive, language and learning disabilities. It must also be presented in ways that accommodate a variety of viewport sizes, from desktop to mobile phone, and browser zoom levels.
