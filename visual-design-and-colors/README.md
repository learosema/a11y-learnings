# Introduction Visual Design and Colors

## Overview

The previous module discussed techniques for making web content accessible to people who can't see it. This module takes somewhat of an opposite perspective. It focuses on visual accessibility techniques for people who can see, but perhaps not with perfect acuity or color perception.

There are people who need to magnify the screen, or who need high contrast colors, or who have a form of color-blindness.

There are also people with reading disabilities or certain kinds of cognitive disabilities who may have good vision, but whose brains may process the visual signals in ways that make things difficult to distinguish or understand unless the elements on the screen are laid out clearly. This module is all about the visual side of accessibility.
