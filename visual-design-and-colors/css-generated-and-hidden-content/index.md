# CSS-Generated Content and Hidden Content

## Introduction:

CSS-generated content: CSS-generated content is read by some, but not all, screen readers. In general, CSS-generated text is not treated by browsers as a fully integrated part of the DOM and is not always made available to screen readers through the accessibility API, so CSS-generated text should be used with caution.

Visually hidden content: It is possible to hide text from both sighted users and screen reader users using either display:none or visibility:hidden. There are other techniques for hiding elements from screen readers only or from sighted users only. Those techniques should also be used very cautiously.
