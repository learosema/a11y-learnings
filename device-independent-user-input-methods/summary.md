# Summary

Users need to be able to interact with web content. This includes all form elements, links, JavaScript features, custom widgets, and all other types of content. 

The primary methods for interacting are mouse, keyboard, touch, and voice. Other methods are available (e.g. eye tracking or single switch devices), but they all essentially make use of, or emulate, one of the other aforementioned methods. 

It is important to consider all aspects of input method accessibility, including functionality, focus management in custom widgets, visual focus and hover indicators, the unavailability of JavaScript gesture actions on mobile devices when the screen reader is turned on, etc. User input method accessibility ensures that users can not only read web content, but also interact with it and submit data when necessary.
