# Touch Input

## Introduction:

When the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 opens in a new window were written, touch devices—and mobile devices in general—were not as advanced or as common as they are now, so the guidelines were not as complete as they could be in that regard.

We have a better idea now in terms of what kinds of things to take into account for touch and mobile accessibility. WCAG 2.1 opens in a new window (which became an official recommendation in 2018) includes more success criteria related to mobile devices.

This course section covers touch functionality with the screen reader on and off (two very different conditions), touch target size, and focus traps. In future versions of WCAG, touch device accessibility will feature more prominently, and will be more integral with the guidelines and success criteria.
