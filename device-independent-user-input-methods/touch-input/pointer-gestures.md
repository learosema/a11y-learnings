# Pointer Gestures

## All functionality that uses multipoint or path-based gestures for operation MUST be operable with a single pointer without a path-based gesture, unless a multipoint or path-based gesture is essential.

For a variety of reasons including mobility issues and use of assistive technologies, users may be unable to perform complex gestures using either fingers or a pointer in order to activate functions on a website or application. 

These gestures can include multi-point gestures that ask the user to use multiple fingers (for example two-finger pinch zoom), or path-based gestures that ask the user to move the finger or pointer in a certain path (for example, swiping).

The intent of this criterion is to ensure that any functionality that is activated through a complex gesture can also be activated through other, more accessible means, such as:

- Single-click, double-click, and click-and-hold
- Single-tap, double-tap, and long press

An example of an essential exception might be drawing a signature on a touch screen on a mobile device. Note, however, that on non-mobile devices without touch screens, web pages use e-signatures that ask you to type, rather than sign, your name, so the pointer gesture would not be essential there.
