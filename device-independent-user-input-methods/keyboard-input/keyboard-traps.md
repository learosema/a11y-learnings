# Keyboard traps

## Keyboard focus MUST NOT be locked or trapped in a particular page element and the user MUST be able to navigate to and from all navigable page elements using only a keyboard.

It is critical to ensure that web content does not "trap" the keyboard focus for users who rely on keyboard functionality. Keyboard traps can occur when there are items like custom widgets, embedded applications, and other content formats all on one page. If there is a keyboard trap on a web page, sometimes the only way to escape it involves either using a mouse (which just is not an option for some keyboard users) or refreshing the web page. Keyboard traps can make interacting with web content extremely difficult for keyboard users.

A couple of ways keyboard traps can be avoided are:

- Make sure the way to navigate through a particular section of the web page (usually the Tab key) can move past that section.
- Create a keyboard stroke to exit the section (you must provide instructions for this to users).
