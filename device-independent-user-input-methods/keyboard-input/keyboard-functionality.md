# Keyboard Functionality

## Functionality MUST be available using the keyboard, unless the functionality cannot be accomplished in any known way using a keyboard.

When functionality is available through a keyboard, people who are blind or use alternative keyboards and devices that emulate keyboards (sip-and-puff devices, speech-to-text software) can use and interact with web content. 

Even people who have low vision benefit from keyboard functionality during times where using a mouse can be difficult.

Usually, functionality that is available through a mouse can be made available through a keyboard.

There are some exceptions to the rule, though. For instance, input that relies on a user's movement (free hand drawing, watercolor painting) will require extremely difficult keystrokes to execute the path inputs.

However, functionality like resizing and drawing geometric shapes can be done through a keyboard because they do not rely on the input of a user's path.

### Note

Always, always, always use real native semantic markup whenever possible.

- eg. for links, use an `a` tag, not a `span onclick`.
