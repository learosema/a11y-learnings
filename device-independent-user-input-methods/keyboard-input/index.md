# Keyboard Input

## Introduction:

People who do not use a mouse — perhaps because they have a dexterity (motor) or vision disability — likely use a keyboard to access websites.

If all functionality can be achieved using the keyboard, it can be accomplished by a wide variety of assistive technologies and user populations. In addition to being able to interact with controls on a page, a person using a keyboard must also be able to find items and follow both programmatic and visual focus.

In this course, we make a distinction between programmatic focus and visual focus. Many developers understand focus to be something strictly programmatic. Certain objects in the Document Object Model have a focus method available to them; and so focus is, strictly speaking, a programmatic thing.

However, we include the visual indication of that focus in our discussion in this and other lessons, primarily because sometimes the visual indication of focus may not exist or may not match what has programmatic focus. And both of these have huge implications for accessibility.
