# The click target size SHOULD be large enough to facilitate easy use with a mouse (including for users with tremors or limited dexterity) without risking activating an adjacent link or button.

Increasing the click target size can be beneficial to mouse users who have low vision and users who are have tremors or are limited in dexterity. For people who have low vision, increasing the target size of an actionable element may help them identify a target with more efficiency. As for users who have tremors or limited dexterity, if a target area is too small, it increases the chances of users accidentally missing the target or activating the wrong target if small targets are close together. Larger target areas may prevent user interaction errors for people who have motor disabilities like hand tremors or people who may use assistive technologies like alternative mouse devices like a trackball mouse or a single switch device.
