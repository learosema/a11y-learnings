# Mouse Input

## Introduction:

Most web developers take basic mouse accessibility into account without thinking about it too much. At a minimum, the functionality will at least be available to the mouse in almost all cases.

Some things that might be neglected, though, are considerations for people who can use a mouse but with reduced precision (such as those with tremors or spasms), or those with low vision who cannot easily tell whether the mouse pointer is over a link or button.

Paying attention to the click target size and the visual hover indicator can help these audiences.
