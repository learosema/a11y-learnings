# Input modalities
## Web content SHOULD NOT restrict use of input modalities available on a platform except where the restriction is essential, required to ensure the security of the content, or required to respect user settings.

Users should not be required to interact with their device in a certain way and should be allowed to use their preferred input method. Users may change between mobile and Bluetooth keyboards or between assistive technologies, depending on their changing context.

There are some exceptions that allow input limitations:

- Limitations related to security purposes
- Limitations that affect the functionality of the page (for example, a web page that teaches people to type may not recognize speech inputs)

### Bad example

Windows 8 had an on-screen touch keyboard, but the touch keyboard could not be used with the physical keyboard simultaneously. This is an input modality restriction that should not exist.s
