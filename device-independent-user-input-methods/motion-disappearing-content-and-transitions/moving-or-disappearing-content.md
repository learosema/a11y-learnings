# Moving or disappearing content

## Content SHOULD NOT move in a way that makes interactive elements difficult to activate.

When moving content or disappearing content is animated at a fast rate, it makes it difficult for assistive technology users to interact with the content.

Keyboard-only users may have difficulty moving focus to the element or seeing the focus on the element. Users with motor disabilities who use a mouse or devices that mimic a mouse may have difficulty with the timing needed to activate the moving element, and screen reader users may not hear or encounter content that disappears too fast from the web page.

Additionally, the quick movement of content can be dizzying or distracting to certain users, including users with cognitive disabilities. Interactive elements within content that moves should not be difficult to activate, and elements should not disappear before a user has a chance to activate them.
