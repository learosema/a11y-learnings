# Motion, Disappearing Content, and Transitions

## Introduction:

Interactive elements that move across the screen are difficult to use. Animations and transitions between events can cause accessibility input problems if they are too fast, too brief, too obtrusive, or if they otherwise interfere with mouse, keyboard, touch, or voice functionality. Developers sometimes make assumptions about users that are unwarranted. 

They assume that users can read quickly, or that they are visually-oriented, for example. If content disappears before screen readers can find it, the users will never know the content was there at all. And if items move on the screen, mouse and touch users may have a hard time activating the moving buttons, links, or controls.
