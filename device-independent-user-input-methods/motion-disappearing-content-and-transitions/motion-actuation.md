# Motion Actuation

## Functionality that can be operated by device or user motion MUST also be operable by user interface components and MUST allow the ability to disable motion actuation.

Examples of motion actuation are shaking your phone or gesturing toward a camera to take a photo. Users must have the ability to perform the same functions with user interface components (for example, clicking the shutter button on a camera). Users must also be allowed to disable motion actuation so they donâ€™t accidentally trigger it.

There are exceptions to this rule:

- The motion is used to operate functionality through an accessibility supported interface (that is, supported by assistive technology as well as by features in browsers and other user agents)
- The motion is essential for the function (for example, a pedometer or GPS-based applications)
