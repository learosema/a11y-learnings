# Device-Independent User Input Methods

## Introduction

Users must be able to interact with web content with a mouse, a keyboard, a touch device, and by voice input. If any one of these methods is unavailable, at least one group of users with disabilities will be unable to use your web content.

This module discusses the rules and techniques for ensuring that users will be able to use your content, scripted events, custom widgets, and so on, no matter what kind of input device they're using.

It's worth it to point out that there are many other kinds of input devices beyond the ones covered in this module, such as single switch devices, sip and puff devices, eye tracking devices, and other more advanced or less common devices.

The good news is that all of these devices are variations of keyboard, mouse, touch, and voice devices. In fact, most of them emulate a keyboard. Some also offer basic mouse emulation. You don't need to know all of the nuances of all the possible kinds of devices, as long as you get the keyboard, mouse, touch, and voice right.
