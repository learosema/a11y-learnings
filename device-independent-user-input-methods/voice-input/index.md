# Voice Input

## Introduction

Voice input software, also commonly referred to as speech recognition software, can be used to command a computer to perform functions such as typing text, navigating web pages, and entering data into forms using keyboard-style interactions or using a mouse emulation mode.

Speech recognition is especially useful for people who have difficulty using their hands, ranging from mild repetitive stress injuries to disabilities that preclude using conventional computer input devices.

All major operating systems — including Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS — have voice activation built in. However, people who need to use speech recognition for primary access to these systems on a day-to-day basis probably require a more complete software tool like Dragon Naturally Speaking.

The principles of designing and developing web content to be accessible to keyboard-only and screen reader users are equally applicable to compatibility with speech recognition software, including:

- Keyboard compatibility for all functionality
- Visible instructions for non-traditional keyboard interactions
- Visible keyboard focus for interactive elements
- Clear indication of what content is actionable and what is not
- Programmatically associated labels and form fields
- Unique and meaningful link text
- Accurate alt text for actionable images
- Accurate semantics for actionable controls
- Adequate click target size
