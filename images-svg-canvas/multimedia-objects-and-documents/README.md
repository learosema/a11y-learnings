## Introduction

Any kind of content that requires a third-party browser plug-in or an external application presents a unique set of accessibility challenges.

At the most basic level, the user may not have the plug-in or application at all, making the content completely unavailable to the user. It is best to provide an alternative version in HTML for users who don't have the required software.

For straightforward text content, that's usually not too difficult. For embedded applications, providing an alternative HTML version may be impractical or impossible, depending on the functionality of the application.

If the plug-in or application has an accessibility API, take full advantage of it by adding in all the accessibility features that the content requires. Examples of software with accessibility APIs are: MS Office applications and PDF (readable with Adobe Reader or Acrobat Pro).

The same types of accessibility rules that apply to HTML also apply to third-party software: provide alternative text for images, use semantic markup (headings, tables, etc.), ensure sufficient color contrast, and so on. The accessibility techniques vary between software applications, and some applications have more robust accessibility APIs than others.
