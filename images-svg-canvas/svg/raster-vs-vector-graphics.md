# Raster vs vector graphics

## Vector images maintain their clarity when magnified

A raster image, also referred to as a bitmap, is made up of a set of dots or pixels, with each pixel assigned a different color value. Vector images on the other hand are made up of basic geometric shapes, such as lines, points or curves and their relationship is based on mathematical equations. Thus, vector images will scale well, regardless of the zoom factor or resolution. The image will remain clear and intact.

Unfortunately, raster images become “pixelated” when zoomed in on and can often become blurry or distorted. The pixels are stretched or shrunk, depending on the action applied to the image. However, raster images do have their place as they are the best format for complex images such as photographs. Vector images on the other hand are best utilized when the drawing is somewhat simplistic in nature, such as line art, logos, charts and graphs, or text.


## File size

Another significant difference between vector and raster images is the file size. Since SVGs are essentially text, individual files can be zipped, resulting in generally smaller file sizes than a raster version of the same graphic. 

This can be especially true when the intended purpose is limited to simplistic drawings such as those noted in the previous section. Furthermore, if the image is to be animated, the added weight on the file size of raster images is significant. Yet with SVG, individual components of the graphic can be animated at run-time using JavaScript and CSS.
