# Animated images

## A method MUST be provided to pause, stop, or hide any prerecorded video-only content that begins playing automatically and which lasts more than 5 seconds.

Visual content that moves can be problematic for people with certain kinds of cognitive disabilities, particularly for those with attention deficit disorders. Content that moves can be distracting, making it difficult for people to focus on content on the web page. The five-second threshold grabs people's attention, but not long enough to distract or prevent a person from using and interacting with the web content.

## Animated images MUST NOT flash or flicker more than 3 times per second.

Content that flashes or flickers more than 3 times per second may trigger a seizure in people who have photosensitive epilepsy or other types of photosensitive seizure disorders. It is important to not create content that may cause seizures for your users.

The Trace Center's [Photosensitive Epilepsy Analysis Tool (PEAT)](http://trace.umd.edu/peat) is a free, downloadable resource for developers to identify seizure risks in their web content and software. If you are uncertain about a video or animation that contains flashing or rapid transitions between light and dark background colors, this tool can be a useful check.
