# An illustrative painting

## Overview

A painting can be described in many ways, depending on how the author intends to use the painting. 
The painting: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:American_Progress_(1872)_by_John_Gast.jpg

## The alt text

The image will require alt text, even if a long description is provided. The alt text can even mention that a long description is available elsewhere.

If the purpose is to show the painting to users and describe its intended meaning by the artist, one possibility is shown below.

Keep in mind that the alt text should usually be brief, and the long description should be made easily available to users by putting it on the page, or in a separate web page available via a link below the image, or in a popup dialog via a button below the image, or some other method that is easy to find and access.

### Option 1: Short alt text

```html
alt="A painting by John Gast in 1872 titled American Progress"
```

### Option 2: Short alt text, with a reference to the long description

```html
alt="A painting by John Gast in 1872 titled American Progress as described below"
```
### Option 3: More detailed alt text

```html
alt="A painting by John Gast in 1872 titled American Progress, showing the spirit
of America heading westward, accompanied by prospectors, farmers, and settlers
while Native North Americans and creatures of the land move away before
her advancements."
```

### Note

Any of the options above can be acceptable. The short alt text would require an easy-to-find longer description. The longer alt text might stand on its own, making the longer description possibly optional.

## The long description

A long description of the painting is required only if the author's intent requires more elaboration than a brief alt text would allow.

A long description can be made available to the users in a number of ways:

- Put the long description on the web page in a paragraph below the image.
- Create a link to another page that contains the long description. The link text could say something like "Detailed description of image."
- Create a button that activates a dialog that contains the long description. The button could say something like "Show detailed description."
- Create a button that expands a long description below the image. The description would be hidden from view initially, then become visible when the user activates the button. The button could say something like "Expand to show detailed description."

### Option 1: An objective long description with as little interpretation as possible

This approach would be appropriate if the author's intent is to allow readers their own interpretation, or when the user's task is to supply an interpretation, as in the case of a learning assessment.

### Option 2: An interpretive description

Note: This example includes all of the text of the previous example, plus some interpretive additions at the end.
