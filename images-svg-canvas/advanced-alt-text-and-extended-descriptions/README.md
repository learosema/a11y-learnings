# Advanced alt text and extended descriptions

## Introduction

Writing good alt text for images is not always an easy task. The goal is to describe the image in a way that communicates the image's intended message — its purpose — to people who are blind.

There is no one right alt text for an image. It all depends on what the content author is trying to convey with the image in a given situation.
