# Icon fonts

## Introduction

Icon fonts allow web developers to add lightweight, reusable icons and images to their designs without adding the extra page weight that images can add. 

Icon fonts also respond to user color preferences, making them ideal in many ways for users who alter the color scheme with tools like Windows High Contrast Mode.

If the user chooses to turn the text yellow and the background black, the icon fonts will turn yellow just like the rest of the text.

On their own, icon fonts are usually not directly accessible. They benefit from being assigned a semantic role (as images), and they need meaningful alternative text.
