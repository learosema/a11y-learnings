# Blindness

- Blind people use screen readers which assist in navigating the web and through applications
- Popular screen readers are VoiceOver (integrates in MacOS and iOS) and NVDA.

## Design Considerations for blindness

- Content must be presented in text or via a text equivalent
- Information must not be conveyed by visual attributes alone
- All functionality must be available using only the keyboard
- Use markup with good structure and semantics
- Custom controls must have the correct name/label, role and value.
- Users must receive immediate feedback after all actions

### On mobile devices

- All features require a click action
- Custom swipe actions on web pages will not work with the screen reader
