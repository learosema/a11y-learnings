# Laws

Web accessibility laws tend to fit into the following categories:

- <b>Civil rights</b> laws emphasize equal rights for people with disabilities, often making it illegal to discriminate against people with disabilities under certain defined conditions, such as employment, access to buildings, government services, or "places of public accommodation"
- <b>Procurement laws</b> require that accessibility be taken into account when making a purchase or when contracting for services.
- <b>Industry-specific laws</b>. Sometimes an industry is so important to accessibility that the government writes a law just for that industry. Examples include telecommunications and airplane travel
