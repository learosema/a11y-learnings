# Collateral benefits

## Overview

When you design for people with disabilities, frequently you come up with solutions that benefit lots of other people. Here are a few examples in both the physical world and on the web:

## Curb cuts on sidewalks

Curb cuts are designed to make it easier for people who use wheelchairs to get onto the sidewalk from the street. Curb cuts also benefit people pushing strollers, people pulling roller bags, people pushing carts, and even people using bicycles, roller blades, and skateboards (though you could make the case that perhaps they shouldn't be on the sidewalk!).

## Visual and auditory announcements on trains

Some train systems and subway systems have text announcements on a screen when the train is approaching the next stop, and they have spoken announcements saying the same thing. Having both of these methods covers the needs of both blind audiences and deaf audiences (though admittedly it doesn't cover the needs of people who are deafblind).

People who can see and hear also benefit. They can listen to the announcement without having to watch the screens, or if people are standing in front of the screens blocking their view. Or if they happen to not be paying attention when the auditory announcement is made, they can look to the screens to confirm which stop is next.

## Mobile apps for train schedules

Mobile apps allow for all types of users — including deaf-blind people who use braille output devices — to keep up to date with train schedules. The apps also benefit anyone who finds it convenient to check the information on a mobile device, such as people in an office building waiting to leave for their commute home, or a person at home trying to plan the best time to pick someone up from the metro station.

## Captions on television shows and movies

The main audience for captions is people who are deaf. Captions are frequently used on televisions in restaurants, bars, and gyms, especially when there are multiple televisions in the same room showing different shows, where the audio from one show would conflict with the audio from another show.

## Captions on web content

Captions can also be helpful when watching a video on a laptop computer or on a mobile device in a public space where it is necessary to be quiet, such as on an airplane, in a library, waiting in line, etc.

## Video and audio transcripts

People who are deafblind need the transcripts. It is the only way they can access multimedia content, so they are the primary audience. It turns out that transcripts can benefit a lot of other people too. Search engines can process the text in the transcript, making video content searchable.

People who may not want to watch the video or listen to the audio — because they don't have time, or because they want to skim for the interesting parts — can read or skim through the transcript.

Experienced screen reader users — who probably have their screen readers set to read text so quickly that most non-screen-reader-users will have a hard time understanding what is being said — may want to read through the transcript to save time too, knowing that their screen reader is much faster than the original video or audio.

## Semantic structure on web pages

Using good semantic structure (headings, landmarks, tables, lists, form labels, etc.) benefits screen reader users immensely, because having the proper semantics allows them to correctly identify the different parts and purposes of the web page.

The act of creating good semantic structure also creates well-organized and well-defined content, which benefits everybody. The headings give logical labels to sections, both visually and semantically.

Marking up tables properly helps ensure the tables are easy to read and interpret. Other aspects of semantic markup have similar benefits.

## Color contrast

Designing content to meet the color contrast guidelines primarily benefits people with low vision, but it also helps people who may be using mobile devices outside in bright sunlight, where the screen may appear washed out, with low contrast.

## Keyboard a11y

Designing for full keyboard accessibility helps people who cannot use a mouse for disability reasons, and it also helps people who simply don't like to use a mouse. Not everyone who uses the keyboard on the web has a disability.

Computer programmers and power users frequently use keyboard shortcuts to do things that other people would probably do with a mouse. For power users, the keystrokes are faster and more convenient than using a mouse.

## Responsive designs

This is an interesting example, because the primary purpose of responsive designs is usually to make the web site work better on mobile devices.

The responsive design also benefits people with low vision who may use the zoom feature in the browser to magnify the web site on their desktop computer. The same zoom capability can be used when a web site is projected on a screen to make the web site easier for people in the back of the room to see.

Responsive design is a case of solving multiple design issues for multiple use cases (some involving disabilities and some not) with one method.


These are just some of the more obvious examples. You may be able to come up with other examples of design ideas or techniques originally intended for people with disabilities, that benefit a wide audience beyond those with disabilities.
