# Creating inclusive designs

## Introduction

Inclusive design sometimes means creating one design that works for all. Most of the time, though, it means creating a single resource or process that can be used in a diversity of different ways.

If you're designing a multi-story building, for example, what's important is allowing people to access all of the rooms and spaces in that building, whether they walk or use a wheelchair, whether they can see or not, whether they can hear or not, etc. The building will have stairs, but there is no requirement for the stairs to be directly accessible to wheelchairs. Adding an elevator allows everyone (not just wheelchair users) to go up or down to different levels, so the main accessibility goal is met, even though the stairs remain inaccessible to wheelchair users. In this example, the designer has to create two "interfaces" for vertical travel: stairs and elevators.

On the web, sighted users can look at a web page and scroll down with the mouse to navigate through the page. Blind keyboard users can't do that, so designers need to add other features to help them navigate, such as headings, landmarks, and "skip navigation" links.

Creating a design that allows for a diversity of methods of use across multiple kinds of abilities and disabilities is the core concept behind inclusive design.
