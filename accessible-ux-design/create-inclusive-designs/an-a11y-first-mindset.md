# An a11y first mindset

## Learning from the mobile first mantra

When web-enabled mobile devices burst on the scene, it took some time for web developers to adapt to the design constraints. They were still thinking in terms of the desktop design being the "real" design, and the mobile design being a secondary, less important design. Mobile designs tended to not be as functional or as visually appealing as their desktop counterparts.

It soon became apparent, though, that people were using their mobile devices at least as much as they were using their desktop devices, and that the mobile designs needed to improve. The design community began to call for a "mobile first" mentality, where the mobile design became the primary design, and the basis for the desktop design. They wanted to flip the old design model upside down and ask designers to rethink everything.

It took time to make the shift in priorities, but we now see evidence of this shift in the way that desktop web sites are designed. Desktop designs have begun to look, feel, and act more like mobile designs. The designs themselves are more fluid, with simplified visual layouts that lend themselves well to responsive designs across devices of various screen sizes.

## Adopting an a11y first mindset

We need to make a similar shift in our mindset to think first in terms of accessibility, rather than think of accessibility as something that can be added at the end of the process. If we wait until the end of the process to add in the accessibility features, it may be too late in many cases, especially when custom JavaScript widgets and AJAX are involved. It takes a lot of time and effort to create custom widgets and AJAX applications. If the logic in them is wrong for accessibility, it probably won't be a simple matter of adding in alt text or labels. It will probably involve a redesign of the basic functionality of the widgets.

In other words, you may have to start over. Nobody wants to do that. Failing to take accessibility into account during the early stages of the design may almost double the actual development time if you find out late in the game that you have to make drastic changes to your code.

Involve your web accessibility team as early in the process as possible. Any other strategy will likely lead to wasted time when parts of the design have to be redone.

If you don't adopt an accessibility first mindset, you may reach the end of the development cycle only to find out that a lot of things have to change to meet accessibility guidelines. You may be tempted to make the decision to go live with the flawed, inaccessible design anyway, but releasing an inaccessible product should not be an option. You can't keep pushing the accessibility down the road for later, because if you did that, later may never arrive... or it may arrive in the form of a lawsuit, which is unpleasant for everybody.

An "accessibility first" mindset streamlines the accessibility design/development/review/release cycle. The goal is to catch accessibility problems in the idea stage, before you have to go back and fix them in the development or review phases.
