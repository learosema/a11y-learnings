# The ability persona spectrum

## Disabilities are not binary

- Think of disabilities on a spectrum rather than as a binary characteristics
- We can extend the disability to include temporary and situational limitations
  - permanent: a defining characteristic of the person's body
  - temporary: injury, sicknes or short-term impairment
  - situational: a condition or context that limits a persons ability

### Mobility/touch ability Spectrum

- Permanent: A person who cannot use their hands
- Temporary: A person with an arm injury
- Situational: a new parent holding a child in one arm

#### Variations among those with permanent mobility impairments

- A person with an arm, but no hand, or a partial hand
- A person with constant tremors
- A person with occasional tremors
- A person with full paralysis of the limbs
- A person with partial paralysis, with some mobility, but limited dexterity or precision

### Visual ability spectrum

- Permanent: a person who is blind
- Temporary: a person with dilated eyes from an eye exam
- Situational: a person who is driving should not look at a computer device

#### Variations among those with permanent visual disabilities

- People who are "legally blind" with some residual vision
- People with low vision who require magnification
- People with reduced contrast vision
- People with varying degrees of color-blindness
- People who are sensitive to bright light

### Auditory ability spectrum

- Permanent: a person who is hard of hearing
- Temporary: a person with an ear infection
- Situational: a person at a rock concert

#### Variations among those with permanent auditory impairments

- Hard of hearing
- Loss of hearing in the high frequency range

### Speech ability spectrum

- Permanent: a person who is non-verbal
- Temporary: a person sick with laryngitis
- Situational: a person in a quiet room in a library.

#### Variations among those with permanent speech disabilities:

- A person with cerebral palsy whose speech sounds slurred
- A person who has undergone throat cancer surgery whose voice now sounds harsh
- A person who stutters

## Solutions for the extreme use cases benefit the minor use cases

When you design for people at the extreme end of the disability spectrum, you create solutions that also benefit people whose conditions are less severe.
