# Learning from a11y design failures

## Introduction

Design failures are all around us. You've probably experienced packages that are hard to open, confusing labels, doors that you weren't sure if you needed to push or to pull, or other kinds of design failures. You may even be guilty of creating bad designs yourself, probably without being aware of it at the time.

If you have a disability, you're already aware of all the design flaws and failures that affect you personally. If you don't have a disability, you can train yourself to be more aware and to identify them when you encounter them.
