## Inconvenient or Stigmatizing designs

### Inconvenient or Stigmatizing designs in the physical world

- Many buildings, in particular older ones, have stairs leading up to the front entrance
- often these buildings have been retrofitted to meet accessible entrances
- often the accessible entrances are a lot less welcoming than the main entrance (eg. off to the side, around the corner, in the back, down the ally, by the trash cans)

Even so, if people have to go around to the back of a building to get in, it is inconvenient for them, and potentially stigmatizing. If a person in a wheelchair is with a group of friends, all of the person's able-bodied friends can go in the main entrance, but the person in the wheelchair cannot. The person's disability is put into the spotlight in an unfavorable way. Everyone is reminded of the person's disability, and the group must wait for their friend to take the long way around (or they could all take the long way around together).

### Web designs that are inconvenient or stigmatizing

- <b>a lesser "accessible version"</b>: a link on an inaccessible site to an "accessible version" that turns out to be a stripped down text-only version. It's inconvenient to not be able to access the main site and stigmatizing because the person realizes they're getting a worse design than the rest of the population.
- <b>Call us for an accessible experience</b>: an inaccessible site that posts a phone number for people with disabilities to call to have someone else help them do wat the web site should have allowed them to do in the first place. This scenario requires the person to disclose the disability to another person (which can be stigmatizing). If the person calls after hours, no one will answer the phone, and the person cannot accomplish what she wanted to until the next day, or until after the weekend is over (which is inconvenient).
- <b>Accessible version "available on request"</b>: An inaccessible PDF document, with a link on the web page to an email address saying, "accessible version available upon request." This scenario has the same problems as the previous scenario: having to disclose the disability, and potentially having to wait a long time.
- <b>Clunky fallback interaction patterns in widgets</b>: A widget designed for mouse interaction (like drag-and-drop functionality) that has accessibility features, but the accessibility features are not intuitive, and have obviously been added only for accessibility compliance, and not as the result of good interaction design.
- <b>Text-only explanation of widgets that aren't accessible</b>: A complex widget, such as a chemistry lab simulation, that was designed for fully-able-bodied users, and which would be difficult to make accessible, so they provide a text description of what you're supposed to experience or learn, without actually letting you experience the widget itself. The information is technically accessible, but the experience is not equivalent.
