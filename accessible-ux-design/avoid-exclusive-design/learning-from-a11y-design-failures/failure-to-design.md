# Failure to design

## Overview

The most common a11y design failure is the failure to design for accessibility at all. Many designers aren't aware of the need for accessibility in the first place, so it's hard to blame them, but that's why this series of accessibility modules exists! Knowledge is power... and opportunity... and responsibility.

## You have to first understand the goal

- Web a11y doesn't happen by accident.
- non-web topic: create a well-organized closet, where people can find all of the shert/shoes/pants and navigate through the items to choose what to wear for the day
- it takes a plan and design to create a well-organized closet. Same goes for accessible web sites.
- starting point: you need to know what accessible design means
-  You need the input of people with expertise. There are closet organization experts. There are web accessibility experts. Each type of expertise is necessary in their respective domain.

## It takes skilled planning to achieve the goal

- Compare that to a bedroom in which the clothes are thrown about the room. 
- You maybe know where everything is, but for others it looks like chaos
- You may still be able to find an outfit this way, but it's a lot harder, takes more work, requires more trial and error and is not a pleasant experience.

This closet organization scenario is actually a pretty apt metaphor for what it feels like for people with disabilities — especially screen reader users — to access web sites.

A well-planned web site with good semantic markup, labels, organization, and structure is easy to navigate and it's easy for users to find what they need. A site that was not designed with accessibility in mind feels chaotic, like a room in which all the clothes are strewn about the bed and floor seemingly randomly. 

It can be extremely frustrating to try to find things or to try to understand how things are organized.
