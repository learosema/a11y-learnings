# A11y rot over time

## A11y rot in the physical world

Ignorance, neglect, and a lack of accountability can break even the most accessible designs when people stop paying attention to accessibility, or when the responsibility is passed to people who don't understand accessibility. It's as if a once pristine design begins to decay and rot, until it no longer serves its original purpose.

### Bad examples

- Barriers placed on wheelchair paths
  - putting a huge potted plant, blocking a wheelchair ramp
  - putting a huge dumpster on a disability parking space, making it impossible to use it
- Permanent barriers blocking wheelchair access
  - install a cement pole in the middle of the entrance to a disability parking spot
  - build a wall where the curb cut meets the sidewalk, making it impossible to get a wheelchair from the street to the sidewalk.

## A11y rot on the web

- that kind of thing happens all the time on the web
- the team builds an accessible web site but treat it as a one time project and fail to build a11y into the process
- Small a11y errors begin to creep in as people forget about accessibility or as new people come in who don't know about accessible design
- Eventually the site has accessibility errors all throughout it again, and it goes back to being just as bad as it was before the accessible design went live.
