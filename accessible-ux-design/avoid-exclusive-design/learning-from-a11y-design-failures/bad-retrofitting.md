# Bad Retrofitting

## Inelegant retrofit designs

- Designers hate to ruin visual aspects of the design
- Web a11y does not affect the visual appearance (it takes effect in the invisible markup, not on the visible web page)
- That's not always the case when the design wasn't created with a11y in mind from start.
- Sometimes it's so incompatible with a11y that you need to implement workarounds of "bolted-on" a11y fixes that look completely out of place
- Or: you need to start over with an entirely new design

## Inelegant designs as temporary fixes

- sometimes it is necessary to implement an inelegant solution temporarily, while designing a more permanent solution.
- Risk: the temporarily solution might turn into the permanent solution
- With web design, you have to make a decision: 
  - design and implement temporarily solution and then a more permanent solution
  - skip the retrofit and just design a real solution
  - either way, it's going to take time to fix the problem
  - the two-phase approach fixes the worst of the problem more quickly, but requires more effort in total.
  - if the problem is less severe, it may be worth it to putt the effort in only one solution

## Placing a11y features behind a11y barriers

- One thing you don't want to do is create a situation where people need assistance to use a11y features
- People should be able to access the a11y features independently, that's the whole point of a11y
- you can't hide your accessibility features or put them behind inaccessible barriers and expect people to be able to use them

### Bad example: wheelchair ramp available upon request

It would be ridiculous to expect a wheelchair user to enter a building to request a wheelchair ramp if there is no way to enter the building in a wheelchair without a wheelchair ramp. Yet somehow someone out there thought that would be a good idea.
