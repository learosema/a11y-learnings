# Examine assumptions

## Overview

- Exclusion = opposite of a11y.
- Exclusion = result of limiting factors in the environment, relative to a person's capabilities
- The environment can either provide access or it can exclude.
- From a design perspective, we create the environment, or at least we can shape it
- A11y is a design challenge, and exclusion is the failure to meet that challenge

## Examining our biases

There are about 7.4 billion people in the world. We have a lot in common, but we also have our differences. If we design our environment and our technologies to meet our own personal needs, that will solve the design problems for people like us, but it won't solve the design problems for the rest of the population. Some of our possible points of difference include things like:

- Cultural background
- Exposure to other cultures
- Experiences
- Privilege and power
- Religion
- Gender
- Sexual orientation and/or identity
- Age
- Literacy
- Technology experience and literacy
- Education
- Native language
- Social network
- Family ties
- Financial resources
- Social class
- Physical health
- Mental health
- Height
- Mobility
- Sight
- Hearing
- Cognitive abilities

You can probably come up with even more points on which we might diverge. All of these differences are normal (i.e. they fall somewhere on a statistical normal curve), meaning that we can't construct a single profile of what it means to be a normal person. There are simply too many variables.

## The danger of unexamined biases

If we don't examine our biases, we are likely to create designs that meet our needs and the needs of people like us, while neglecting the needs of everyone else.

Let's take the example of a 64-year-old woman living in Sudan who has never traveled more than 40 miles from where she was born, who has been blind from birth, has never attended school, whose only experience using a computer was when using a neighbor's smart phone (and she only used its phone capabilities, not any apps), and who has lived in poverty all of her life. She is going to have a vastly different set of assumptions about the world, and a vastly different set of needs when compared to a 24-year-old male UX designer at a large company in the Seattle area who has no disabilities, and who has grown up with the conveniences of an upper middle-class lifestyle.

It is possible to design an environment that would accommodate the needs of both of these individuals, but not without some forethought and planning. It isn't going to happen by accident.
