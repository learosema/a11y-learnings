# Avoid exclusive design patterns

## TLDR

- A11y problems are the result of biased design decisions
- Exclusion is the result of design patterns that fail to take into account the full spectrum of people who will use the design
- often accidental
- the disability is not the problem â€“ the design is
- look past your own biases to recognize design patterns that cause exclusion

## Introduction

Accessibility problems are the result of biased design decisions. Exclusion is the result of design patterns that fail to take into account the full spectrum of people who will use the design. Often these biased design patterns are accidental. Designers don't realize that their design patterns assume certain user characteristics. It is common to assume, for example that everyone can see and can use a mouse. Web designs created for sighted mouse users will cause problems for blind keyboard users.

It would be a big mistake to say, "well, blind keyboard users have trouble with the design because of their disability." The disability is actually not the problem. The design is the problem. The design itself causes a disabling situation that could be avoided with a better design. It is 100% possible to create an accessible design that works for blind keyboard users. It is up to the designer to do so.

The same logic applies to designs that exclude people with other types of disabilities. A building with stairs but no elevator is a disabling situation for a person who uses a wheelchair; adding an elevator to the design solves the design problem. An announcement system in a bus terminal that uses only audio announcements creates a disabling situation for people who are deaf; adding the same announcements to computer screens or LCD text screens would solve the problem.

Make an effort to look past your own biases to recognize design patterns that cause exclusion.
