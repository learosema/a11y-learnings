# Designs that cause exclusion

## Overview

The most important question when considering exclusion is: what in the design of the environment led to this person's exclusion?

You can, and should, identify characteristics of the person that are incompatible with the environment, but do it from the perspective of analyzing how the environment could be better designed.

Don't assume that the environment is "just the way things are," or that the person is somehow at fault for their incompatibility with the environment. It is a design flaw in the environment, and design flaws can be fixed.

## A design-centric approach

This design centric approach to a11y and exclusion is in contrast to outdated models of disability that focus on a person's inabilities and limitations. Yes, the person has actual limitations (we all do) but if we're always defining the limitations as an inherent property of the person, we'll miss the chance to envision other possibilities for our environment.

For example, up until recently, most buildings were designed with staircases leading up to the entrance, even though wheelchairs have been around in one form or another for centuries.
