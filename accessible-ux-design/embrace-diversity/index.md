# Embrace Diversity

## Introduction

- People with disabilities are in the minority
- That doesn't make their characteristics irrelevant to the majority
- On the contrary, often when we examine the needs of minorities we better understand the needs of all people.
- Embrace the lessons that we can learn from unexpected sources in the diversity of humanity.
- Focusing on a few can sometimes be the best way to create solutions for all.

## Diverse categories of disabilities

In the context of disabilities, the major categories to consider are:

- Blind
- Low vision
- Colorblind
- Deaf
- Deafblind
- Dexterity/motor disabilities
- Speech disabilities
- Cognitive disabilities
- Reading disabilities
- Seizure disorders

## Multiple disabilities

- Realize some people have multiple disabilities (eg. low vision + motor disability)
- Sometimes the design considerations for multiple disabilities are the sum of the considerations for two different kinds of disabilities
- Other times, the combination of disabilities is different enough to warrant its own category, as in the case of people who are deafblind (both deaf and blind).

## Diversity of all kinds

Disability is only one aspect of human diversity and identity, but it is an important one, because it can be found among people of all kinds, all races, all ethnicities, all gender identities, all ages, all socioeconomic classes, and essentially all other categories that you might use to describe people. We are all susceptible to disabilities, whether we have one now or not.

Sometimes the paying close attention to the intersection of different aspects of the human experience — such as disability and poverty — can yield insights that might be overlooked otherwise.
