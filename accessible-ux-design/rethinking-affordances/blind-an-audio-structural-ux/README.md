# Blind: An Audio-Structural UX

## Understanding the UX of users who are blind

First, we'll state the obvious: people who are blind do not rely on the visual design of an interface. Not everyone who is categorized as blind is completely blind, so some people can perceive things like light and dark areas, but for all intents and purposes, the visual interface is not the most important part of a UI for someone who is blind.

People who are blind listen to screen readers read web pages out loud, but it isn't just a matter of listening to a web page from start to finish. Screen reader users have many ways of navigating the content. One of the most common ways is navigating by type of element (landmarks, headings, form elements, links, images, lists, etc.).

Interactive components — like form elements and custom JavaScript widgets — require more sophisticated ways of presenting the semantic information to screen reader users. The key concepts are to present the name, role, and values/properties of each element, and to update the values as appropriate when they change (for example, marking a region as either collapsed or expanded).
