# Rethinking "affordances"

In this section, the goal is to push the boundaries of normal design paradigms. A web design offers certain _perceived possibilities_ to people who are fully able-bodied, and a different set of perceived possibilities to people who use screen readers, or screen magnifiers, or eye-tracking input devices.

In fact, there are multiple interfaces for the same web page, depending on what capabilities and devices you bring to the web page.

The challenge is to think through the many possible interfaces to your designs and make them all work in the best way possible.
