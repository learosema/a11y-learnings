# The Challenge of cognitive disabilities

## Introduction

The most neglected kind of disability in web design is cognitive disabilities. The [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) barely scratch the surface of the types of things you can do for people with cognitive disabilities, for two main reasons:

- The spectrum of cognitive disabilities is wide, both in terms of the types of cognitive disabilities and their severity.
- It's difficult to write rules that can be judged objectively to be in or out of compliance. A rule saying to make things "user-friendly," for example, is unquestionably good advice for people with cognitive disabilities, but how do you know when you've succeeded? The problem is that success can be so subjective and difficult to verify.

The W3C is aware of the poor representation of guidelines in WCAG that directly benefit people with cognitive disabilities. They put together a [task force on cognitive disabilities](https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/) to provide recommendations for new guidelines that would benefit people with cognitive disabilities. They put together

- [Cognitive disabilities user research](https://w3c.github.io/coga/user-research/)
- [Cognitive Accessibility Roadmap and Gap Analysis](https://w3c.github.io/coga/gap-analysis/)
- [Issue Papers for The Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Accessibility Task Force (COGA)](https://w3c.github.io/coga/issue-papers/) (Note: At the time this module was written, this document is the most incomplete and least polished of the three mentioned here)

Many of the best practices recommended by this task force, though, will likely not make their way into the next version of WCAG because they are still too subjective to be verifiable. The WCAG charter requires that all of the guidelines be objectively verifiable.

As a result, cognitive disabilities will, unfortunately, continue to be neglected from a legal and compliance perspective. But that's no excuse from a design perspective. There is still much that you can and should do. This section will discuss some ideas about how to do that.
