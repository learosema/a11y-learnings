# Key Design concepts

## Principle 1: Make it easy for users to succeed

We start with the idea of making it easy for users to succeed because it gets to the heart of the design challenge. In the end, you want your users to accomplish the tasks they're supposed to accomplish. Broadly speaking, you want your design to be intuitive, compelling, and successful for the user. The tasks should be well-defined, with no confusion or distractions.

## Principle 2: Simplify

One of the key mantras of cognitive disability accessibility is to simplify everything.

### 2.1: Simplify the visual interface

How many visual design columns do you need? How many widgets and features do you need? How many sections of content do you need on a single page? How many sub-navigation lists do you need?

The answer to all of these questions is probably: fewer than you think.

Each web page should have one main task or feature, and the visual interface around that task or feature should be minimal.

### 2.2: Simplify the navigation

The main navigation list should contain the shortest list possible that still makes sense and is still useful.

Planning a good navigation scheme requires thoughtfully organizing the purposes or sections of the web site into categories, most likely in a hierarchical taxonomy (for example a "Video games" category could have 3 main sub-categories ("Action Games," "Strategy games," and "Puzzle games," each with hundreds of products underneath them). Deciding on the best categories can be a time-consuming process. Take into account how users want to find things, not just how it makes sense for the business to organize them.

Keep any sub-menu lists to a minimum, to keep things as streamlined as possible.

### 2.3: Simplify the processes and tasks

UX professionals know how hard it can be to simplify complex tasks to make them easy for users. It's also one of the most rewarding design challenges when you get it right. From a business perspective, the difference between hard tasks and simple tasks can have a direct impact on sales. If it's hard to buy something, for example, many people will give up on the process before making the purchase.

Pay the most attention to the core processes and tasks of a web site. On an airline web site, the core tasks could be defined as follows:

- Booking or changing a reservation, including all flight amenities
- Checking in for a flight
- Accessing a personal travel itinerary
- Accessing the status of a flight
- Accessing a personal frequent flyer account
- Accessing flight schedules
- Accessing carrier contact information

In fact, those are the core tasks identified by law in the Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA) in the United States. Other tasks could be added to the list too, depending on the functionality and business goals of the web site or — to flip the perspective around — depending on the customer needs and goals.

For a bank, the core tasks might be defined as follows:

- Check current account balances and transactions
- Accessing current and previous monthly statements
- Transfer sums of money between accounts
- Accessing and editing personal account information (address, email, phone, etc.)
- Accessing bank contact information
- Apply for services (loans, checking accounts, etc.)

#### Think through the different task paths

Remember that the actual steps a person has to go through for a given task will vary depending on their access methods. The path through a task for a sighted mouse user may be very different than the path through the same task for a blind keyboard user. It can help to draw a flow chart or process diagram to examine the steps in detail.

### 2.4: Simplify the content

The text — and the ideas in the text — may need to be simplified too. This is one of the hardest goals to achieve.

Method 1: Summaries. One thing that can help is to provide preview summaries at the beginning of sections of content and/or summative conclusions at the end of the content. Creating bulleted lists of page highlights is one way to do it. Creating a table of contents at the top of the page is another way, assuming that the table of contents represents a summary of the main concepts. Summaries essentially give users two versions of the same information: a short one and a long one.

Method 2: Change the content itself. In other cases, it may be best to modify the content itself, which may mean simplifying the vocabulary, eliminating large chunks of text, phrasing things differently, and so on.

## Principle 3: Provide alternative representations

It helps to supplement text with things like videos, audio, illustrations, photos, diagrams, and so on.

### Example: Origami crane

Provide text instructions, illustrated instructions, video instructions + video transcript

## Principle 4: Allow extra time

Some people with cognitive disabilities process information more slowly than the general population. Give them enough time to react to things like session timeouts, deadlines, special offers, interactive content, animated content, and so on. Depending on the context, it may also be appropriate to allow users to postpone or cancel timeouts, or to extend time limits.

## Principle 5: Focus the user's attention

### 5.1: Eliminate or reduce distractions

At the most basic level, you don't want to distract your users. Distractions can include things like:

- Advertisements
- Autoplaying videos, audios, or animations
- Timed interface elements like carousels or rotating banners
- Auto-updated information, such as social media feeds (Facebook, Twitter, etc.), stock price tickers, etc.
- Visually compelling content that isn't part of the main content or message
- Visually imbalanced designs
- Busy designs with no clear focus or purpose

Eliminating, or at least reducing, these known distractors is a good starting point. Beyond that, you can also do things to purposefully focus the attention of your users on the most important parts of the content.

### Principle 5.2: Present a small number of clearly-defined tasks

What is the purpose of the web page? If you have 20 tasks that you think a user might want to do, but not one of them is emphasized, then the page doesn't really have a purpose. Power users may appreciate the flexibility, but essentially all users will benefit from a design that makes the purpose obvious.

### Principle 5.3: Make the experience compelling and fun

The more enjoyable the experience, the easier it will be for people to understand and to continue using.

To take this thought even a little further, some people with cognitive disabilities appreciate a game-like environment. You probably wouldn't want to literally turn the interface into a game, because that would increase the cognitive burden of completing tasks, but some game-like elements can make it more fun, as long as those elements are part of the primary purpose of the web page.

At the very least, you can use visual design elements that look fun, such as the three cartoon faces in the screen. 

Instead of just asking the question with text ("Do you like the idea of working in a fast food restaurant?"), the design below uses faces to represent each of the three choices. A green smiley face represents "I like it!" A yellow neutral face represents "I'm not sure." A red frowny face represents "I don't like it!"

### 5.4: Use visual design cues to draw attention

#### 5.4.1 Blank space:

Isolate important content by surrounding it with blank space ("white space").
A far off photo of a woman standing in a yoga pose in the middle of the salt flats, showing lots of ground and sky around her 

#### 5.4.2 Color:

Use bold/dramatic colors.
Popsicles of various colors of the rainbow

#### 5.4.3 Contrast:

Use high contrast colors, and put the high contrast on the important elements.
The black silhouette of a man in a doorway with light from behind; he is surrounded by white, but the room itself is dark

#### 5.4.4 The gaze of others:

Use photos or illustrations showing people (or animals) looking at the object that you want your users to pay attention to.

#### 5.4.5 Surprise:

Employ the element of surprise by showing imagery that is unexpected, humorous, or out of place in some way. Be careful that the surprise is used to draw attention to the right things, and that it doesn't become a distractor.

#### 5.4.6 Framing:

Visually frame the important elements with visual outlines, borders, or some other visual scheme that puts the important content in the center of the visual frame.

#### 5.4.7 Directional cues:

Use arrows or other visual directional cues to point to important content.

#### 5.4.8 Leading lines:

Use pathways or leading lines to direct the person's gaze to the important elements.

#### 5.4.9 Motion:

Motion can draw the user's attention too, but be very cautious with this one, because of the other accessibility concerns with motion.

### 5.5: Use text to draw attention

- Big bold headings: Use styles for headings that are big and bold (ensure the headings are real headings in the HTML!)
- Brevity: Use short words and phrases in headings
- Surprise: Use attention-grabbing words
- Punctuation: Exclamation points and question marks give extra emphasis, when used appropriately
- Bold: Use bold text to highlight key ideas, especially at the beginning of sections or passages of text.
Summary words: Highlight the main idea of a sentence or paragraph at the beginning of the passage of text.

### 5.6: Use auditory cues to draw attention

Using auto-playing audio on web sites is generally not advisable, but for the sake of completeness, we should mention that audio can draw the user's attention. Under some circumstances, audio may be acceptable. Brief error sounds, confirmation sounds, notification sounds, and so on, can be effective.

In a game-like approach, you could have a voice say "Good job!" or "Congratulations! You finished!" or "Oops. Looks like you need to fix something" or other messages that fit the circumstances. Again, use this approach with caution. Using sounds like this to benefit people with cognitive disabilities can be somewhat at odds with the needs of people using screen readers, who may have a hard time listening to both their screen reader and the web page's sounds at the same time. Ideally, users would have the option to turn these sounds off completely. Be sure any sounds like this are brief, and they are not the only way that information is conveyed. Convey the same information in visual text also.

## Principle 6: Provide immediate feedback for both success and error scenarios
Users will make mistakes, even on web sites with the best designs. As a general rule, the sooner you provide feedback, the better. The WCAG requirement emphasizes error messages, but success messages are also important.

When users activate a feature or submit a form, you must tell them whether the action was successful or not.

When a user fills out a form, at a minimum the user should be presented with a confirmation or error message when the form is submitted. Immediate inline error messages, prior to submitting the form can be good for some people too:

- For sighted users, inline validation of form elements is the fastest way to provide feedback.
- For screen reader users, inline validation error messages can be tricky, and in many cases are not effective, but as long as the inline validation is designed well, there is generally no harm, even though screen reader users won't experience the error messages until after submitting the form (unless they navigate backward in the form to the fields with errors).
- It's important to note that screen reader users often explore forms by tabbing through them, prior to filling out any part of the form. If they do this, tabbing into and out of a required field without typing some content into the field can trigger the inline validation. For example, the user may be presented with an error message saying "Error: field cannot be empty." When the user goes back through the form, the presence of error messages may be confusing to the user. That said, you have to balance the positive aspects of inline feedback with the drawbacks for screen reader users.
