# What it means to have a cognitive disability

## Overview

There are many kinds of cognitive disabilities. Some people have only one kind — like a short-term memory deficit — and other people have many kinds of cognitive disabilities. Some people have mild cognitive disabilities. Others are severely affected. It's impossible to construct a single profile of what it means to have a cognitive disability, but it is possible to describe some of the main categories.

### Note

It's worth noting that there are many causes of cognitive disabilities too: congenital conditions of various kinds (including, but not limited to genetic disorders), traumatic brain injury, illnesses, and more. You don't have to know a person's medical diagnosis to understand the kinds of things designers need to be aware of. It's the categories of cognition — explained on this page — that matter most.

## Complex concepts

Broadly speaking, many people with cognitive disabilities are not able to understand complex concepts as easily as the general population. 

They may not always understand things like implied meaning (if the concept is not mentioned explicitly), cause and effect, interrelationships, patterns, procedural logic (like programming), structural hierarchies or taxonomies, and multiple layers of meaning.

## Abstraction

Some people think very literally, and have a difficult time understanding abstract concepts. They can think concretely about specific objects, but they may not be able to generalize from those specific objects. For example, if there is a dog standing next to them, they may have no problem noticing some things about that specific dog (the fact that it is covered in hair, for example), but they may not be able to transfer those observations to their internal concept of dogs in general (they may not be able to come to the conclusion that dogs, as a category, are covered in hair). The problem is in making connections between ideas, inferring relationships or patterns, or categorizing ideas.

Abstract ideas include things like "justice," or "mercy," or "virtue." By way of contrast, concrete ideas include things like "car" (especially a particular car), or "hand" (especially one's own hand, or a specific person's hand) or "hamburger" (especially the one they are currently eating).

Some people need to hear direct commands, rather than abstract statements about what a person ought to do. Saying "Hot stoves can cause burns" may not be enough to prevent some people from touching a hot stove. They need to hear something more like, "Don't touch the hot stove, because it will burn you!"

## Sarcasm and satire

Some people think very literally, and have a difficult time understanding the difference between plain statements and sarcastic or satirical statements.

In fact, they may not understand the humorous intent at all, because they will take the statement in the opposite way it was intended.

## Self versus others

Some people find it fundamentally difficult to see things from the perspective of another person. They are quite literally self-centered, not because they want to be mean or selfish, but because their brain cannot adequately think sympathetically or empathically about others.

They experience the world in terms of its effect on them personally, and don't realize that their actions affect others. They can see that their actions affect themselves but can't fully step back and think about how others are also processing the world from their own separate perspectives.

## Problem-solving and critical thinking

When things go wrong, some people may have a difficult time figuring out what the problem is and how to recover from it or how to move on. In fact, some people with cognitive disabilities will be unable to proceed unless they receive help from another person or from an intelligently-designed error validation and support system.

## Speed

Many people with cognitive disabilities need extra time to perform tasks. Whether it is because of memory issues, attention deficit issues, problem-solving issues, or any of the other kinds of issues mentioned on this page, the need for more time is consistent across most of the categories of cognitive disabilities.

## Memory

Some people have a hard time keeping track of things in their working (immediate) memory, or in their short-term memory, or may have trouble committing thoughts into long term memory. The more that a person is asked to remember, the greater the risk that the person will forget some or all of the information.

## Attention

Some people have a hard time paying attention to the task at hand and may be easily distracted by external factors. Online advertisements, animations, or other elements designed to distract a person will inevitably present a difficult challenge to people with attention deficits. In some cases, a person may need someone else to help keep them on task.

## Reading

There are various kinds of reading disabilities, ranging from mild difficulties to the complete inability to read anything. In some cases, the root cause is in visual perception. In other cases, the cause is rooted in language comprehension. Either way, alternatives to text — like videos, illustrations, and audio — can be good ways to help people with reading disabilities.

## Speech and Language

Some people lack the ability to express themselves through speech or language. In other cases, language comprehension is the problem. Non-verbal methods of communication may work for some people in these situations.

## Math

It is somewhat common to hear people in the general population say things like, "I'm not good at math," and they may be right in some sense, but there is also an actual cognitive condition, called dyscalculia, that affects a person's ability to perform numerical calculations. 

The brain of a person with dyscalculia is actually incapable of certain types of mathematical thinking. It's not just a matter of being slow at math or having a psychological aversion to it. It's a more pervasive condition that prevents them from performing mathematical calculations.

## Behavior

Some people have very little impulse control. If a thought enters into their mind, they may act on it without thinking about the consequences, even when it is socially unexpected or inappropriate to do so.

In fact, some people may not understand what social appropriateness means and may be incapable of making decisions based on social expectations.

## Visual Perception

In rare cases, some people may not be able to process visual information. A person with prosopagnosia cannot recognize the difference between people's faces, but may be able to recognize the difference between voices. Other conditions affect a person's ability to recognize objects by sight but may be able to recognize them by touch.
