# Accessibility and Inclusive Design

## Terminology

### Inclusive design

A design methodology that seeks to enable and to accommodate the full range of human diversity, including a wide spectrum of abilities and disabilities. The main goal is to create a unified approach to design that enables multiple methods to access the same functionality.

### Web A11y

The qualities that make a web experience available to the widest possible group of users. Web accessibility refers to the end result of an inclusive design process.

To add a bit more detail to the definition of Web a11y, the [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) list four main principles (POUR)

- Perceivable – information and ui components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive
- Operable – ui components and navigation must be operable
- Understandable – Information and the operation of UI must be understandable
- Robust – wide variety of user agents must be supported, including assistive technologies

### Usability

The qualities that make a web experience intuitive and easy to use. A usable web design aligns with the purpose for which the web site was created.
