# The challenge of user-generated content

## Introduction

If you open up your platform to user-generated content (e.g. social media, blog comments, etc.), you're going to have inaccessible content all over the place. That's just a given. 

Most people don't know anything about accessibility, and they're usually too lazy to pay attention to it even if they do know something about it. What to do?

Here are the main strategies you can employ:

### Automate accessibility fixes 

Create sophisticated algorithms to intelligently fix inaccessible content, without burdening the people who add the content. As exciting as this option sounds, it usually requires artificial intelligence to pull off well, and is impractical and unreliable in most cases.

Even the best solutions can't read the minds of the content creators, so the end result will always be of a lower quality than human-mediated accessibility features.

### Limit the type of content users can post

If you constrain the options to only pre-designed accessible templates, the number of accessibility errors will be lower, but the platform itself will be less powerful to users.

### Prompt and guide users to create accessible content during the authoring process

Make accessibility features and instructions prominent, and show errors when accessibility features are missing, prior to publishing the content.

### Provide utilities to check and fix existing content for accessibility errors

For content that has already been posted, provide ways to audit and repair accessibility errors.

### Make the authoring tool itself accessible

Make sure that people with disabilities can use your authoring platform.


All of the options in the above list are addressed in the [Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG10/) . This section takes a closer look at each of these approaches.
