# Designing an Accessible User Experience

## Introduction

### Exploring the possibilities

The purpose of this module is somewhat different from the other modules in this series. Rather than present a list of accessibility rules, we'll push the boundaries a little and engage in a few thought experiments.

The goal isn't just to comply with guidelines or laws, but to try to create a compelling, enjoyable, and useful experience for people with disabilities.
