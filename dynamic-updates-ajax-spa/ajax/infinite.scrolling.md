# Infinite Scrolling

## An "infinite scrolling" feature MUST allow users to reach all areas of the page with the keyboard.

An "infinite scrolling" feature is an area of the page that continues to load new content every time the user scrolls or tabs near the bottom of the page. It was invented as a way to allow users to access continuous content — like Facebook feeds — without having to do anything but scroll.

The idea succeeds well enough for mouse users, but it makes it very difficult for keyboard users, who can never tab past the infinite scrolling area because every time they try to do so, new content loads and inserts itself next in the tab order.

- [Bad example: content placed after infinite scroll area](https://dequeuniversity.com/assets/html/module-dynamic/infinite-scrolling/bad/index.html)

## An "infinite scrolling" feature MAY be activated only at the user's request.

One way to fix the accessibility problems of infinite scrolling areas is to abandon the automated aspects of it, and let users choose when to load new content.
