# AJAX

## Introduction:

AJAX events are a common part of modern web design. They speed up the user experience by bypassing the need for full page reload events. You can load small parts of the user interface or content at a time, either at the user's request or based on other events. The biggest two issues with AJAX are:

Knowing when and how to notify screen reader users about the new content, and
Focus management
This section provides some practical examples that cover these topics and more.
