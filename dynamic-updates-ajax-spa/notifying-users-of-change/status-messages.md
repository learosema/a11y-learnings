# Status messages

## Status messages MUST be programmatically determinable through role or properties such that they can be presented to the user by assistive technologies without receiving focus.

When new information appears on-screen without receiving focus, it must be coded as a status message so that assistive technologies can alert the user to the information.

Otherwise, users may not hear the new information if they use a screen reader, or see the information if they use a screen magnifier and it appears outside of their view.
