# Auto-Play

## Overview

Visual content that moves can be problematic for people with certain kinds of cognitive disabilities, particularly for those with attention deficit disorders and reading difficulties. Content that moves can be distracting, making it difficult for people to focus on content on the web page, and it can be difficult to read while it is moving. Allowing content to move for up to five seconds grabs people's attention, but not long enough to distract or prevent a person from using and interacting with the web content.

## A method MUST be provided to pause, stop, or hide any media content that begins playing automatically and which lasts 5 seconds or more.
The requirement to provide users a mechanism to pause, stop, or hide content applies to two categories of content:

- Moving, blinking, or scrolling content including:
  - movies and synchronized media presentations
  - animations
  - real-time games
  - scrolling stock tickers
- Auto-updating content including:
  - automatically updated weather information, news, and stock prices
  - auto-advancing presentations and messages

For both types of content, a mechanism must be provided to pause, stop, or hide the content. That mechanism cannot tie up the user's focus on the page, keeping the user from interacting with the rest of the page. 

For example, it would not be adequate to provide a control that stopped the content only so long as the control had focus; this would leave the user unable to interact with the rest of the page.

In addition, there are two more considerations for auto-updating content:

- A mechanism may be provided to allow the user to control the frequency with which content is updated, and
- There is no five second exception for auto-updating content since it makes little sense to auto-update for just five seconds and then stop.

An exception applicable to both categories of content is when the moving or auto-updating content is essential to the activity. A common example of an essential activity is an animation that plays to indicate that a page, content, or process is loading.

Don't forget to ensure that the mechanism to control the content is easy to locate, is keyboard operable, and is clearly labelled as to its purpose.
