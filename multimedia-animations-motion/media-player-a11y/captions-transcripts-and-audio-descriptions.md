# Captions, Transcripts, and Audio Descriptions

## Media players SHOULD allow users to access captions, transcripts, and audio descriptions.

Option 1: Provide accessibility features in the media player itself
An ideal media player has the built-in ability to allow easy integration of captions, transcripts, and audio descriptions with minimal effort on the part of the person preparing the media.

### Example

Provide icons, for example: 

- [closed captions](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons/closed-captioning?style=solid)
- [audio descriptions](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons/audio-description?style=solid)
- [transcript](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons/file-alt?style=solid)
- [sign language interpretation](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons/sign-language?style=solid)

## Option 2: Provide the accessibility features in alternate ways

All of these accessibility features are requirements, but the media player itself may not have to provide those features if they are provided in some other way.

#### Captions

For example, you can produce a video with the captions embedded in the video itself. It is not absolutely necessary to have a media player that supports web captioning technology if the video is already captioned.

### Note
Note that it is usually MUCH easier to use web captioning than to produce captioned video files! Plus, users can customize the caption appearance with web captioning, and they cannot customize it all if the captions are in the video itself.

### Audio descriptions

The same is true of audio descriptions. You can produce two versions of a video: one with audio descriptions and one without. Each video can be presented separately, without the need for the player to support the ability to toggle audio descriptions on and off.

### Transcripts

In the case of transcripts, the transcript can be presented above or below the video. The transcripts do not have to be included in the media player itself.

Generally speaking, it is usually easiest to use a media player that supports as many accessibility features as possible, rather than supply the accessibility features in a less systematic way.
