# Media Player Accessibility

## Introduction:

In the past, embedding videos and other types of media into web pages required custom plugins like Windows Media Player, Flash, RealMedia, QuickTime, Java, and so on.

All of those technologies can still work to play stand-alone videos on a computer, but they are much less common on the web because HTML 5 video has made the plugin approach mostly obsolete. HTML 5 video works well, and the browser's built-in media player can be accessible, though the actual accessibility of the media player varies from one browser to the next and depends on the level of support in the screen reader.

One way to achieve reliably accessible results across browsers is to use an existing HTML5-based player that has been designed and tested for accessibility. These instructional modules use the open source [Able Player](https://ableplayer.github.io/ableplayer/) where possible. Able Player provides a way to include captions, transcripts, audio descriptions, and sign language interpretation, plus all of the controls are designed to be accessible to keyboard users and screen reader users.

Other media players that have been designed with accessibility in mind include [OzPlayer](https://www.accessibilityoz.com/ozplayer/), developed by Accessibility Oz, the open source [Nomensa media player](https://github.com/nomensa/Accessible-Media-Player), the open source [PayPal media player](https://github.com/paypal/accessible-html5-video-player), among others.

This section discusses what it takes for a media player to be considered accessible.
