# Customizability

## Media players SHOULD allow visual customization of captions.

The fact that users benefit from being able to customize the visual appearance of captions is a point made elsewhere in this module, so the idea will be presented here only briefly. Make the customization options easy to find and easy to select.

## Media players SHOULD remember user preferences.
Ideally, a media player would remember user preferences in a global way, so that any time the same media player is used, the user's settings are retained. That saves the user the time that would be spent changing the caption settings each time. Possible ways to accomplish this include the following:

- Use JavaScript to set a cookie on the user's machine, then retrieve the cookie as the media player is loaded.
- On password-protected sites, store the media player preferences along with other user data on the server, and retrieve the preferences as the media player is loaded.

# Media players SHOULD allow full screen video.

For the benefit of users with low vision, provide a full screen option to allow the video to be viewed at maximum size on the user's screen.
