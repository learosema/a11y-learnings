# Animations and Motion

## Introduction:

Any time you have motion on a web page — such as an animation, or a background video, or parallax effects, or transitions — you can run into a few different kinds of accessibility risks. People with vestibular disorders may experience dizziness if the motion on the page feels too overpowering to them.

People with attention deficit disorders may become overly distracted. And if there is sound, people using screen readers may have a hard time hearing their own screen reader over the video sound. This section discusses these types of problems.

"Vestibular disorder" is a term that may not be familiar to many people. Vestibular disorders encompass a broad category of conditions that affect a person's balance.

Symptoms can range from occasional, mild balance problems to severe cases that interfere with walking, bathing, or doing other daily activities. Symptoms can be constant or can be prompted by visual stimuli that give the appearance of being in motion or off balance — such as background motion on a web page.
