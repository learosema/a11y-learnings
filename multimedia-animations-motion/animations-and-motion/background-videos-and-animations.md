# Background Videos and Animations

## Important content MUST NOT be conveyed through background videos and animations, unless users have full control over playback, and full access to any required captions, transcripts, and audio descriptions.

The general idea of background videos is to provide a visually appealing, and somewhat unexpected, enhancement to web content. The background video should be considered extra information, not critical information.

If any critical information is conveyed only in the background video, then the video must be fully accessible, with captions, a transcript, and audio descriptions, if the video cannot be fully understood by blind audiences by listening to the original video.

## A method MUST be provided to pause, stop, or hide any background videos or animations that begin playing automatically and which last 5 seconds or more.

It's best to not have any content start playing automatically when the page loads. The best practice is to allow users complete control over the start and stop time of moving content or audio content.

As a bit of a compromise, WCAG AA allows videos to autoplay for up to 5 seconds, but if the content plays longer than 5 seconds, a mechanism must be provided to pause, stop, or hide the content.

## A method SHOULD be provided to pause and restart background videos and animations.

Any time a video or animation starts playing, users should be given the ability to pause and restart it. WCAG AA does allow videos to play for 5 seconds without requiring a pause feature, but the best practice is still to include a pause button under all circumstances.

## The contrast of the text against background videos and animations MUST be a minimum of 4.5 to 1 for small text or 3 to 1 for large or bold text.

## Movement within background videos and animations SHOULD be minimal.

Any movement on a web page draws the user's visual attention. That can be a good thing if you're trying to get the user to focus on something, but by definition, a background video or animation is supposed to be background content. 

It's not supposed to be the focus of attention. With this in mind, any movement in the video should be minimal and subtle.

Users with attention deficit disorders may find it particularly hard to concentrate on the main content if the video is too busy or distracting.

## Background videos and animations SHOULD NOT contain sounds.

If you include sounds in a background video or animation, the sound forces users to listen, which defeats the intent of putting the video or animation in the background. Screen reader users are faced with the fact that their screen reader is talking to them AND a video is making sounds at the same time, which can be disorienting and annoying. If the video is too loud, it may even drown out the sound of the screen reader.

Screen reader users cannot see where the video is, so they have to hunt for the video player controls to turn the sound off, if there even are video player controls. It can take a long time to find the controls. In the meantime, the user is frustrated and is having a bad experience on the web page.

If you're going to include sounds, it is best to provide the video in the normal way, with all the user controls and accessibility features, and to not set up the video to auto-play.
