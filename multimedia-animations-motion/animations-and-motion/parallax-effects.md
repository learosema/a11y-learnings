# Parallax effects

## Overview

Parallax effects refer to scripted visual elements that respond to user actions — such as scrolling or moving the mouse — that cause some elements on the page to move differently than other elements on the page.

A background image may move at a slower pace than the overlying text, for example. Or the background image may remain completely static and unmoving while text scrolls over top of it.

The visual effect is impressive, largely because it is somewhat unexpected and novel, but it also has some downsides.
People who are susceptible to nausea or who experience dizziness or vestibular disorders can feel those negative symptoms when viewing parallax effects.

## Parallax effects SHOULD be kept to a minimum, in terms of the total number of parallax effects, the amount of parallax within each individual effect, and the size of the area affected.

The more parallax effects you include, and the more extreme they are, the greater the risk that you'll cause problems for people with vestibular disorders.

## All content and features within parallax scrolling content MUST be accessible by keyboard.

Keyboard users must be able to access the hidden areas of a parallax scrolling area and use all of the features of the web page. If the scrolling is scripted to respond to mouse events, or if the hidden content is set to display: none in the CSS, keyboard users may not be able to access the hidden parts of the content.

## The contrast of the text against all parts of a moving background MUST be a minimum of 4.5 to 1 for small text or 3 to 1 for large or bold text.

The text must always be readable against the background and must pass the WCAG contrast guidelines of 4.5 to 1 for small text or 3 to 1 for large or bold text. When text moves over background images, some parts of the image may be darker than others.

If there are any places where the text appears over low contrast areas of the background, it would be best to place a solid background color behind the text, to ensure the contrast is always good in all situations.

## Parallax scrolling can decrease usability.

Not everyone understands how to use parallax scrolling interfaces. The first time people are presented with a parallax scrolling page, they may not even realize they have to scroll at all, especially if the image or first "slide" takes up the entire screen. Users may leave the page thinking there is nothing more to see.

Similarly, if the parallax scrolling feature includes a large image that is completely static, with text that moves over top of it, some users may become confused and wonder if something is broken or if they are doing something wrong.

## Parallax scrolling pages can negatively impact SEO

Depending on how the pages are created, parallax designs can negatively impact search engine optimization (SEO), especially if the content is initially hidden with methods such as display: none. There are ways to avoid the negative SEO impact, but it's worth noting this potential downside.
