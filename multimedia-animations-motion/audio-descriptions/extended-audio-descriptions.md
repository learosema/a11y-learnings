# Extended Audio Descriptions

## Where pauses in foreground audio are insufficient to allow audio descriptions to convey the sense of the video, extended audio description SHOULD be provided for all prerecorded multimedia (video plus audio) content.

Sometimes, the audio track of a movie or video does not provide sufficient gaps for the audio description narrator to adequately describe what is happening on the screen.

In these cases, an extended audio description may be provided. With an extended audio description, the video will periodically be paused to provide the narrator extra time to describe what is happening visually on the screen, and then the video will resume.

As with regular audio descriptions, the extended audio description track should be provided as a feature that may be turned on or off.
