# Methods of presenting audio descriptions

## Method 1: Create a separate version of the video with embedded audio descriptions.

Using this method, you will create two versions of the video: one with no audio descriptions (the regular sound track) and a separate video with the audio descriptions embedded in the sound track. There are multiple ways to provide access to both videos including:

- Provide links on the web page to both versions of the video. One link might be “video title” and the other “video title – with audio description”
- Embed the original video in the page and provide:
  - A link to go to the audio-described version of the video on a separate page
  - A button to open up the audio-described video in a dialog
  - A button to toggle which video is presented in the page (i.e., hide the original video and show the audio-described video)

### Note:

In the audio described version of a video, the closed captions should also include the audio description track narration.

The advantage of this method over Method 2, below, is that it does not rely on a video player that can support multiple sound tracks.

## Method 2: Create a separate audio file of just the audio descriptions, and allow users to turn on the audio description option to play the audio descriptions synchronously with the video.

In this method, only one video file exists, but it has more than one audio track available. The video player's control bar includes a dedicated button that allows the user to toggle between the original audio track and the described audio track.

This is analogous to the closed caption button that toggles captions on or off. For this method to work, your video player must support multiple audio tracks; many don’t.

The audio description button can look like the letter "D" as in the screen shot of the Able Player below, or the letters "AD" as seen in the common logo for audio descriptions.
