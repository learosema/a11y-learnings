# What to Include in Audio Descriptions

The goal of an audio description is to convey all important visual information verbally that dialogue and other sounds cannot. 

Examples of relevant information aside from dialogue and sounds include facial expressions, scenes, and important actions that cannot be identified by sound. The target audience for audio descriptions is people who can hear but who cannot see. Think of it as describing a stage performance for a radio audience.

To delve deeper into the art that is making excellent audio descriptions, the American Council of the Blind's Audio Description Project has created a comprehensive document called Audio Description Guidelines and Best Practices opens in a new window.

## General Principles
- The level of description possible will be determined by the soundtrack. Within time constraints, descriptions should include all information which is important to the plot or characterization — locations, settings, characters, clothing, facial expressions and mannerisms, lighting, colors, etc.
- Descriptions should, as far as possible, coincide with the actions being described.
- Descriptions should be written in clear, simple language. Technical terms should be avoided unless the context demands it and if possible explained.
- Descriptions should be in present tense.
- New speakers in a scene should be identified.
- Descriptions should not give any more information than the sighted viewer would have.
- The passage of time between scenes should be indicated.
- Visual elements which are imagined or remembered, or are obviously part of a dream, should be differentiated from 'real' events.

## Writing style

- The description should give a feel for settings but shouldn't overwhelm people with detail.
- Descriptions should be neutral. Interpretive descriptions, value judgments and aesthetic opinions, e.g. "She looks into the distance, thinking of home", should be avoided.
- The source of unidentified sounds and speech should be described (but only when these would be obvious to the sighted viewer).
- Whole sentences should be used where possible when describing action. It is acceptable though to identify characters by just giving their name, or to describe objects or settings in incomplete sentences (e.g. "A lake with a small island in it.")
- The description should not draw attention to itself. The describer should blend in seamlessly with the rest of the audio.
- The term "we see", and cinematic terms like "the camera zooms in…", "a close-up…" should be avoided.
- Racist or offensive terms should never be used, but ethnicity should be noted when it is essential to plot or character.
- The style of the audio description should match the style of the program. For example, it is acceptable to be more colloquial in children's programs.
- Every gap in dialogue does not need to be filled with description. The music and ambience can tell the story too.

## Sounds

- No description is necessary when there is an obvious audio cue such as a phone ringing.
- If a description must fall on either side of a sound, it is better for it to be before the sound than after.

## Subtitles

- For subtitled films, the appearance of subtitles should be noted in the first instance then prefixed with "subtitle" or "he says", "she says", etc.

## Songs

- If it is necessary to describe over a song, describing over important lyrics should be avoided.

## Credits

- Credits at the beginning and end of a video should be read out.
