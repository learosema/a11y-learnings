# Determining When Audio Descriptions Are Needed

## Overview

When applying the rules below, the first step is to assess whether or not your video displays content important to understanding the video that is not already described in the audio track.

Since the purpose of an audio description is to provide information that can be seen but not heard, not all video content requires an audio description. For example, a video of a company PR representative reading a press release, with no additional visual information shown such as photos or charts, will not require an audio description.

### Note

Producing audio descriptions can be time and resource intensive. When creating a video, it may be possible to develop the script in such a way that all important visual information is also conveyed through the original soundtrack of the video. 

For example, a video shows a sales manager talking and showing a chart about the company's July sales numbers. The sales manager's script can include a description of all of the content in the chart such as: "Of July's 42 million dollars of revenue, 9 million dollars came from Widget A, 3 million from Widget B...".

Including all of the relevant visual information in the sales manager's script will avoid the need for editing in audio descriptions later on. Of course, this may not be possible in all situations, but it is something to keep in mind as you plan and create a video.

## Prerecorded multimedia (video plus audio) MUST include audio descriptions.

Prerecorded video files containing essential information that is only conveyed visually MUST come with an audio description track.

Again, keep in mind here that while an audio description track is acceptable per WCAG guidelines, it is better to also include a transcript so that deafblind users can easily access the information using a refreshable braille output device.


### Example 

Example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8BD9txkGL4

There is no dialogue in the above video clip. You can hear the sound of Katniss walking through the forest, and some background music. In addition to these sounds, you can hear a narrator saying the following:

#### Audio Description Transcript

Signs on a tall wire fence read "District Boundary, no access beyond this point" and "High voltage." Katniss steps through a gap in the wire and steps into the woods beyond. She glances around before reaching into the hollow of a fallen tree. She draws out a wooden bow. From another tree, she plucks out a sheath of arrows and straps it over her shoulder. Katniss makes her way through thick green vegetation. Bow and arrow at the ready, she walks over a fallen tree suspended over the forest floor. She pauses, her gaze locked on a deer in the distance. Leaning against a tree trunk, she aims the bow and arrow. The deer sniffs the air and moves out of sight.

### Examples: Move trailers with audio descriptions

## Prerecorded video-only content MUST include audio descriptions OR a text transcript.
As mentioned previously, in cases where you have the either/or option for audio descriptions versus a transcript, keep in mind that a transcript is the only way that deafblind people can access the information and therefore this alternative benefits a wider audience. Of course, it's best if you have both (audio descriptions and a transcript).

### Good Example: Video with Audio Descriptions and Transcript

This silent video demonstrates a magic trick, and audio descriptions and a transcript accompany the video, which describe the visuals for the blind.

#### Audio Description Transcript

A magician squirts flammable liquid in a cylindrical metal serving container measuring about 12 inches in diameter. A white rabbit sits patiently on the table next to the container. The magician lights the liquid on fire, flames rise from the container, but the rabbit doesn't flinch.

The magician covers the container with the lid and jostles it gently. He lifts up the lid to reveal a brown rabbit inside. The flames have been extinguished. The white rabbit turns around, disinterested. The man places the vial of flammable liquid and the lighter inside the metal container, puts the lid back on top, then moves the container aside, and positions the two rabbits on the table facing the camera.

## Audio descriptions MAY be provided for live multimedia (audio plus video) content.

Providing a live audio description of an event or performance is both an art and a science, requiring not only trained audio-describers but also the technical platform by which to provide the alternate audio. The inclusion of live audio descriptions for live multimedia content is not common.

However, it is exciting to note that according to the American Council of the Blind's "Audio Description Project," the number of audio describers for live theater continues to grow, allowing blind patrons to more fully enjoy the rich experience of live theater.

There is no requirement under WCAG 2.1, Section 508, or CVAA to provide an audio description for live multimedia content. However, if you record the live content and make it available for later viewing, you may need to add an audio description at that time.

## Audio descriptions MAY be provided for live video-only content.

Similar to live multimedia, providing an audio description for live video-only content is not common, but it is the only way live video-only content can be made accessible to people who are blind or have very low-vision.

There is no requirement under WCAG 2.1, Section 508, or CVAA to provide an audio description for live video-only content. However, if you record the live content and make it available for later viewing, you will need to add an audio description at that time.
