# Audio descriptions

## Introduction

Audio Descriptions in a video add to the experience a person who is blind will have when consuming the content. A lot of things happen in movies that are completely visual, with no auditory component.

For example, a person can make a facial expression, but not say any words. The camera can show a mountain scene, but no one in the movie says, "this is a mountain scene." 

There is a lot of visual information that is important to a video that may not be easily understood by someone who does not see the screen. Audio descriptions are the solution to make visual information in movies accessible to blind people.

Audio descriptions are a recording of a person explaining the visual aspects of the video that aren't in the video's original dialog or narration. The narrator speaks when there are gaps in the dialogue and other sounds of the movie, providing enough commentary to give blind people the context they need to understand the story.

Audio description works best when users can turn it on or off, or when there is a separate version of the video with audio descriptions for blind users, in addition to the original version without audio descriptions.
