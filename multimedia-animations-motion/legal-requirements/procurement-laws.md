# Procurement Laws (Section 508, EN 301 549)

Procurement refers to an organization's process of purchasing goods and services from external sources. The goal is to purchase products and services that meet accessibility guidelines by evaluating them and including accessibility as a part of the decision process.

When choosing between competing products and services, the purchaser should ask for an accessibility report from the vendor as a first step. 

Most vendors tend to exaggerate the accessibility of their products and services, so the purchaser should conduct its own accessibility assessment before purchasing, especially in the case of purchases that affect large numbers of people.

## Procurement is a Legal Liability

Most of the procurement-specific laws (such as Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act in the U.S. and EN 301 549 in the E.U.) are targeted at government entities, but if an organization were to purchase inaccessible products and services, that could put the company at legal risk in terms of compliance with civil rights laws, so accessibility considerations still matter, even outside of the government.

## Procurement Affects Profitability

Looking at things from the reverse perspective, when government entities want to purchase products and services from an organization, they are required to take accessibility into consideration, so if any of the organization's products and services fail to meet accessibility procurement standards, it may lose the government's business.

## Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act

Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act requires the U.S. federal government to take accessibility into account when procuring information technologies: websites, telephones, copiers, computers, and other technologies, including both hardware and software.

Video captions and audio descriptions are specifically addressed in section 1194.24 Video and multimedia products, paragraphs (c) and (d):

(c) All training and informational video and multimedia productions which support the agency’s mission, regardless of format, that contain speech or other audio information necessary for the comprehension of the content, shall be open or closed captioned.

(d) All training and informational video and multimedia productions which support the agency’s mission, regardless of format, that contain visual information necessary for the comprehension of the content, shall be audio described.

### Section 508 applies to:

- US federal government entities only, but the effects of Section 508 have permeated the information technology landscape because so many businesses, non-profits, and local and state governments do business with the federal government. To sell to the federal government, private entities have to offer accessible products and services.

### Section 508 is enforced by:
- Consumers (people with disabilities) filing formal complaints

## EN 301 549: "Accessibility requirements suitable for public procurement of ICT products and services in Europe"

The European Union created a set of standards for use in ICT (Information and Communication Technology) procurement legislation, similar to Section 508 in the United States. Mandate 376 established the initiative to create European accessibility procurement requirements, and the result is ETSI standard [EN 301 549 (PDF)](http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/01.01.01_60/en_301549v010101p.pdf), titled "Accessibility requirements suitable for public procurement of ICT products and services in Europe".

Published in February of 2014, EN 301 549 is not a law in and of itself, but it directed Member States to incorporate its provisions into their own procurement laws by April 2016. In 2016, also Australia announced that it is adopting the EN 301 549 guidelines in its government procurement practices.

The original mandate was to create a set of guidelines for use in public procurement of ICT, meaning ICT used in government and other tax-supported entities. The private sector was not part of the original mandate. Some countries have limited the scope of EN 301 549 to the public sector, as originally intended, but the door has been left open to allow a broader interpretation.

The portions of EN 301 549 that deal with the web refer to WCAG 2.0 level AA.
