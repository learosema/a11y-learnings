# CVAA: The 21st Century Video Communications and Accessibility Act

## Overview of the CVAA

The CVAA, signed into law in the United States in 2010, requires "advanced communications services and products" to be accessible to people with disabilities, including video communications, text messaging, web browsers on mobile devices, and other similar technologies.

It applies to all entities already covered by FCC regulations (namely: telecommunication hardware and software providers and television broadcasters and television hardware/software providers). With respect to web content, the CVAA applies to all online content that previously aired on television and which was subjected to FCC regulations.

### Disclaimer

The description of the CVAA in this section should not be construed as legal advice.

## Captioning Requirements
Perhaps of greatest significance to web developers, all video programs presented with captions on television must be presented with closed-captions on the internet. As it is written, the CVAA does not explicitly apply to web-only videos, but the video captioning requirement in WCAG 2.1 applies to videos of all kinds on the internet, whether broadcast on television or not.

### The CVAA captioning requirements apply to:

- All full-length programming delivered to consumers in the United States using the Internet that previously aired with captions on television in the United States.
- Beginning in January 2016, clips of programs (i.e., excerpts of full-length video programs) that previously aired with captions on television in the United States:
  - January 1, 2016: a single video clip of a previously-aired, captioned television program
  - January 1, 2017: multiple video clips of a previously-aired, captioned television program
  - July 1, 2017: video clips of live and near-live programming

### The captioning requirements of the CVAA do NOT apply to:

- User-generated content (e.g., home videos) shown on the Internet, unless they were shown on TV with captions.
- Movies shown on the Internet, unless they have been previously shown on TV with captions.

## Enforcement of the CVAA

The CVAA is enforced by consumers (people with disabilities) filing informal or formal complaints with the FCC.
