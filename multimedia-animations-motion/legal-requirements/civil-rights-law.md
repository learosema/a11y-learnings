# Civil rights laws

## Overview

A civil right is an individualâ€™s right to freedom and to equal treatment, to not be subjected to discrimination based on certain characteristics. Civil rights legislation looks to protect rights such as privacy and freedom of speech, as well as protect people from discrimination in multiple settings, such as employment, housing, public spaces, and education.

To protect people with disabilities, countries like the United States and Japan have enacted laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability and protect the rights of people with disabilities. Below are a few of the common laws that protect rights for people with disabilities.

The descriptions of civil rights laws in this section represent only some of the prominent laws around the world. The text here should not be construed as legal advice.

## United States

### Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act

Signed in 1977, Section 504 is an amendment to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. It was the first civil rights law to protect people with disabilities from discrimination based on their disability. Section 504 requires that any organization which receives federal subsidies must accommodate people with disabilities.

With respect to electronic content, Section 504 requires that online information be compatible with assistive technologies and auxiliary aids be provided when required to ensure equal opportunity to access electronic information. 

Auxiliary aids include accommodations such as braille or large print versions of materials, qualified interpreters or readers, and captioning of videos.

#### Section 504 applies to:

- Many public sector entities, including all state, local, and federal government entities, K-12 schools, and postsecondary schools (e.g., colleges, universities, and vocational training schools).

#### Section 504 is enforced by:

Consumers (people with disabilities) filing formal complaints

### The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)

The ADA, passed in 1990, is a broad civil rights law that prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in employment, architectural design, transportation, examinations and courses, and other services offering "public accommodation". 

Even though the ADA says nothing about web accessibility explicitly, many of the web accessibility lawsuits in the United States invoke the ADA as the basis for the legal complaint, because of the language about "public accommodation". 

The technical standard most often referred to in settlements and consent decrees regarding inaccessible web content is WCAG 2.0 Level AA.

#### The ADA applies to:

- Private entities that own, operate, lease, or lease to places of public accommodation. Essentially this refers to businesses and other organizations open to the public, with the exception of religious entities and private clubs.
Federal and state government entities.

#### The ADA is enforced by:

- Consumers (people with disabilities) filing formal complaints

#### Related Cases:

National Association of the Deaf (NAD) vs. Netflix, 2011

### Ontario: The Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)

AODA became law in 2005 and seeks to create a barrier-free Ontario by "developing, implementing and enforcing accessibility standards in order to achieve accessibility for Ontarians with disabilities with respect to goods, services, facilities, accommodation, employment, buildings, structures and premises on or before January 1, 2025."

AODA references Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 standards for web content:

- Beginning January 1, 2014: new public websites, significantly refreshed websites and any web content posted after January 1, 2012 must meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level A
- Beginning January 1, 2021: all public websites and web content posted after January 1, 2012 must meet WCAG 2.0 Level AA other than criteria 1.2.4 (live captions) and 1.2.5 (pre-recorded audio descriptions)

AODA applies to:

- Private or non-profit organizations with 50 or more employees
- Public sector organizations

## Japan

## The Law to Eliminate Discrimination against People with Disabilities

One of the actions Japan took to eradicate social barriers for people with disabilities was establishing the Law to Eliminate Discrimination against People with Disabilities in June 2013. 

The legislation prohibits discrimination based on disability and requires organizations and private entities to provide the necessary accommodations that remove the social barriers people with disabilities face. Although the law was passed in 2013, it only recently took full effect in April 2016.
