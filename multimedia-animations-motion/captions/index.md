# Captions

## Introduction:

### Why captions are important

Captions are text-based versions of content presented in an audible format. Captions present the same information that is provided either through audio-only content or audio content that is synchronized with video content. 

Providing captions for audio-only content and audio synchronized with video content helps to ensure that the audio is available to individuals who are unable to access information presented in an audible format, especially individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. 

Even though captions are used to make audio content accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing, captions may also help those who may not be fluent in the language used in the audio content; and they may help people who can hear content better process the information that is presented audibly.

### Captions versus Subtitles

The terms "captions" and "subtitles" are sometimes used interchangeably, though they are not the same thing. 

Both of them are text synchronized with the dialog and narration in a video, but one is intended specifically for deaf audiences (descriptions of sounds are included in addition to the dialog and narration), and the other is intended to provide a translation from one language to another, or as a clarification of what is being said in the same language if the audio is unclear. 

As to which term is which, there are regional differences in how the terms are used.

In the United States, "captions" refer to text intended for deaf audiences, and "subtitles" refer to text supplied as a language translation or clarification (e.g. for unclear speech).

In the UK, the term "subtitles" usually refers to the text intended for deaf audiences, though "captions" is sometimes used in the UK in the same way that it is in the United States.

If that sounds a bit confusing, it is, but as long as you know that the two types of synchronized text exist, and as long as you know the conceptual differences between the two, the exact terminology is somewhat less important.

### Other Benefits of Captions

Though captions are intended for people who are deaf or hard of hearing, there are other benefits of incorporating captions in video and audio content:

- Search engine optimization (SEO): Search engines can only crawl through text. They can't view videos. So, when captions are provided, search engines can find the information in the captions because captions are text-based.
- Second language learners: For learners who are unfamiliar with the language spoken in the audio, they can use captions to follow along to comprehend the spoken language.
- The ability to watch or "listen to" video/audio with the sound off: If a viewer is in a situation where he or she can't listen to the video and/or audio content (e.g. when in the room with a sleeping baby), he or she can use captions to view the information presented within the audio.

### Auto-Captioning

Auto-captioning is promising, but not yet reliable enough because of weaknesses in speech recognition.

You can use auto-captioning as a starting point to create captions as they can be somewhat accurate in terms of timing captions; but you will almost always need to edit and correct mistakes produced by auto-captioning because of the weaknesses in speech recognition â€” and you may need to edit the timing information to get more accuracy with captions synchronizing with audio content.
