# Live events

## All live multimedia (video plus audio) events that contain dialog and/or narration MUST be accompanied by synchronized captions.

Live multimedia events on the web require synchronized captions, just as prerecorded multimedia events do. Examples of live events include:

- Webinars
- Web calls and web conferencing (e.g. Skype, WebEx, GoToMeeting, etc.)
- Live streams of talks, speeches, lectures, presentations, etc.
- Live news broadcasts
- Any live event with spoken words as part of the audio content
- Captions that are in sync with the live audio that not only present spoken word, but identify significant non-spoken sounds, enable people who are deaf or hard of hearing to access auditory information that is included during the live multimedia presentation.

Live captions are possible — live television programs such as news broadcasts in the United States are required by law to be captioned — but arranging for live captions requires extra planning and resources. There are costs to consider in terms of both time and money. Nevertheless, live captions are the only way to make live video and/or audio broadcasts accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing.

Real-time captions require a human transcriptionist, or stenographer, to listen to the words and type them on a stenograph machine, which is the same tool used in court reporting. Stenography allows for faster typing than regular computer keyboards.

The typed words are fed into software that presents the text to users in real time. The captions themselves are always delayed by a few seconds, due to the time it takes to type them, plus any network-related delays between the stenographer, server, and client.

Very few commercial online collaborative tools on the market provide a way to allow live captions. YouTube is one service that allows for live captions. Tools like GoToMeeting, Join.me, FuzeBox, and other similar collaborative tools lack this important feature.

## Live audio consisting mainly of dialog and/or narration SHOULD have synchronized captions.

If the live audio content contains dialog and/or narration, it is usually appropriate — and may in fact be necessary — to provide live synchronized captions. If the live audio content contains music or other similar types of sounds, live captions may not be necessary, and may not be meaningful, but it depends on the context.

Live streaming of text descriptions can be useful even for things like music concerts, to give deaf audiences a sense of the event itself, in real time. In some cases, posting a text transcript or description of the event after the event has concluded may be acceptable, and is a bit of a judgment call.

## Live Captioning Techniques
Adding live captions to a video stream can be technically challenging. It requires a live connection with the text output from the person transcribing the event, and it requires a way to present the captions synchronously to the user. There are multiple ways of presenting the captions, including the following:

### Method 1: Use a Media Player that Supports Live Captions

If you're fortunate enough to have access to a media player that supports the integration of a live caption feed, that would be the preferred option. Users can turn the captions on if needed, or they can turn them off if they don't need them.

### Method 2: Present the Captions on the Web Page Adjacent to the Video

You could set up a web page with an AJAX-driven caption feed that presents the captions on the same page as the video, but not through the video player itself. Ideally the captions would be directly below the video, but in some cases it may be appropriate to present the captions to the side of the video.

### Method 3: Use Television Captioning Technologies

You could integrate the captions directly into the video stream as open captions, using the same technologies available for television broadcasts. If you have that kind of technology available to you, that's a good way to go.

### Method 4: Present the Captions on a Separate Web Page

Though far from ideal, sometimes the only method available is to present the captions on a separate web page, separate from the video. The user can have two browser windows open at the same time to watch the video in one window and read the captions in another. This option is only appropriate if you have no control over the web page through which the video is served, or if the video is served through some other technology, such as web conferencing software, that does not allow the integration of a live caption feed.
