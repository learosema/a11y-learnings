# Open vs Closed captions

## Overview

There are two different types of captions that can be used in videos: open captions and closed captions. Closed captions are a time-stamped text file (.srt, .sami, .xml) that is loaded into a media player to be displayed in the video when toggled on. 

Open captions are always on and are "burned into" the video layer during production. Production Studios calls this process 'subtitling'.

The benefit of closed captions is they can be toggled on and off. But it is dependent on the player supporting caption files. The benefit of open captions is no matter what player is involved, a person who needs captions will have them. But captions can be distracting to many users, so not being able to toggle them off can be frustrating.

When showing a video at a conference, open captions are always recommended so the presenter doesnâ€™t need to worry about the player, the caption files, making sure they are toggled on, etc. But for just an online video, a caption file works great. You will want to make sure the video player on your site allows captions.
