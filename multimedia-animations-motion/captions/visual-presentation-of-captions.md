# Visual Presentation of Captions

## Captions SHOULD NOT exceed three lines on the screen at a time.

It is important that captions are divided up properly to make them easier and faster to read, and so that they do not block essential visual components if accompanied by video. When captions are not broken up, viewers may need to reread captions in order for them to make sense.

## Caption line breaks, when necessary, SHOULD be inserted at logical points between phrases, rather than in the middle of a phrase.

When there are multiple lines of captions within a frame, the captions should be broken up where natural or logical points are in the statement. If the statement contains grammatical breaks like commas or semicolons, they can also be used to mark spots where captions should be broken up.

Keep the following in mind for creating breaks in the captions:

- A new sentence should start a new caption and a new speaker. If sentences are extremely short, they may be presented in one caption.
- For longer sentences, break them up according to logical or grammatical breaks (e.g., where commas are used); and use either the articles, conjunctions, or prepositions in the sentences to start a new line or a new caption.
- If descriptive wording (non-speech information in brackets or parentheses) is used, captions can be broken up where the descriptive wording stays with any wording being described by the non-speech information.

### Example

```
This is a long caption
that does have break points
and is easier to read
```

## Captions SHOULD be typed in mixed case.

The old tradition for lettering for captions used to be using all uppercase lettering. However, it is now recommended that mixed-case lettering is used to increase the readability of captions.

## The default font for captions SHOULD be a sans-serif font.

Again, to enhance the readability of captions, using sans-serif fonts is recommended over serif fonts. Captions are meant to be read quickly, so it is critical that legible fonts are used to compose captions. 

The serifs (the small lines at the end of strokes in letters) may make serif fonts a little more difficult to read over sans-serif fonts as they make lettering appear to run together for some users.

## The maximum number of characters per line of captions SHOULD NOT exceed 32 characters.

Captions should not exceed 32 characters per line. Anything longer may make captions unreadable and may block important visual content.

## Captions SHOULD remain on the screen for a minimum of 1 second under all circumstances, AND SHOULD take into account the number of words, at 0.3 seconds per word, if possible.

Captions should be displayed in a frame for at least 1 second on the screen. For lengthier captions, utilizing the rule of 0.3 seconds per word may be a better option. Viewers should be given enough time to see and process a caption. Captions that disappear from the screen too soon or not soon enough will be ineffective.

## Captions SHOULD be positioned to not obscure on-screen text, people's faces, or other important visual information.

Captions are generally positioned at the bottom of the screen and the text is centered. However, captions do need to be moved if they block on-screen text, people's faces, or other important visual content. Any time captions are moved, though, the text should be aligned either center or left.

Right alignment is usually avoided for captions to not inhibit readability. If captions need to be moved, they should be moved at the end of a sentence or a grammatical break in a statement. Also, never move a caption within the same frame. Make sure captions are moved to a new position in a new frame.

## Captions SHOULD be precisely synchronized to the audio, except when doing so would make captions difficult to read.

There may be times during an audio presentation where a person's speech is too rapid or other elements within the audio are moving at a quick rate. When this happens, captions that are synchronized with the audio and displaying faster than the minimum duration can be difficult and nearly impossible to read, thus defeating the purpose of captions altogether.

Though it is always a rule that captions display audio content verbatim, they may need to be reduced to be effective when speech or other elements are occurring too rapidly in the audio. Reducing content in captions, though, should always be a last resort.

If captions must be edited, it is extremely important that they still communicate what the audio is conveying as much as possible. Try not to rephrase content, but delete words that are unnecessary instead.

## The default color combination SHOULD be white text on a black background.

White text against a black background provides the high contrast for viewing captions, especially if viewers are unable to customize the captions according to their preferences.

## The default contrast ratio between font color and background color in captions MUST be a minimum of 3:1 (assuming a minimum font size of 18 point).

Similar to the rule for large real text, captions that are at least 18-point in font size must have a color contrast ratio of 3:1 between the captions text and background. 

The ratio helps to ensure that captions are easier to read for people who might have low vision. Also, because captions are displayed against visual content, it is important that captions can be seen clearly even by those who do not have low vision.

## The default font size for captions SHOULD be at least 22pt.

Captions should use a font size that can be easily read. In conjunction to using a sans-serif font, the font size for captions should be at least a 22-point font. Keep in mind, though, that font size may depend on the type of media player used. This is one good reason to use a media player that permits users to customize the look of captions in videos.

## The default font weight for captions SHOULD be normal (not bold).

Captions should be clean and easy to read, so the best font weight to use for captions is a normal font weight. While a bold font weight may provide heavier character strokes, it may be more difficult to read, especially at the speed that is required to view captions.

## Colors in captions MUST not be used as the only way to convey meaning.

There may be viewers who use captions that are colorblind. So, if color is used to convey meaning, such as placing emphasis on a word or phrase, viewers who are colorblind may miss the significance. Do not rely solely on color to communicate importance in captions.

Instead, use the captions text itself to convey meaning. Depending on what is being conveyed, you can convey meaning through punctuation, using italics or all caps for emphasis, or through descriptive captions if more information is needed to stress meaning.

## Italics or all caps MAY be used for emphasis in captions when punctuation alone does not convey the full meaning.

Sometimes punctuation may not be effective enough for emphasis in captions. If this is so, then italics or uppercase lettering can be used to place emphasis on words and phrases in caption text. 

For instance, sometimes shouting or yelling can be emphasized using an exclamation point, but if an exclamation point doesn't quite convey the intensity of the shouting, the words that are shouted can be typed in all caps. 

The default for emphasis should be italics, though; and all caps should be used for heavier emphasis like shouting. Be careful not to use too many capital letters in captions, though, as they may be difficult to read, especially when intermingled too much with mixed case.

## Quotation marks (or optionally italics or underline, if supported in the caption format) and mixed case capitalization SHOULD be used to designate titles (e.g. of books or movies) when appropriate in captions.

When it is appropriate, quotation marks and mixed case lettering should be used to set off and compose titles of books or movies in captions. If you use a file format that supports italics or underlining, those styles can be used to present movie titles or book titles in captions.

## The last caption frame SHOULD be removed from the screen during long silent intervals.

If there are long periods of silence, a caption should not be displayed, as a viewer may think audio is playing during the silence. Remove any captions that do not denote the period of silence.

For background music, do not display the description of the music the entire time background music is playing. The description should be removed after 4 or 5 seconds of being on screen.

## Any gaps in captions SHOULD be a minimum of 1.5 seconds.

The length of any gaps that occur between captions should be a minimum of 1.5 seconds. Gaps shorter than 1.5 seconds will create a jerky visual effect of captions appearing and disappearing. If the time can be used to display the caption, then that time should be used.

## Periods of silence SHOULD be noted as such when the visual content gives the impression that there may be important sounds or speech.

If the visual content looks to indicate that there is audio when there actually is no sound playing, captions should communicate to the viewer that there is a period of silence during the visual display. Descriptive wording can be used to convey silence.

## Additional on-screen time for a caption frame SHOULD be added when the caption contains unfamiliar or uncommon words or phrases.

Though captions are meant to be read quickly, they are ultimately meant for viewers who cannot access the audio content to understand and comprehend a multimedia presentation. When there are uncommon or unfamiliar words used in speech, consider giving viewers a little more time to process the terminology.

If enough time isn't given to comprehend uncommon or unfamiliar words, the captions may prove to be ineffective and self-defeating as they wouldn't allow for viewers to adequately understand the information being presented.

## Additional on-screen time for a caption frame SHOULD be added when there is a lot happening visually on the screen.

When there is a lot of visual content on the screen, it may distract from viewers reading and comprehending captions on the screen. So, to make sure that viewers don't miss any information, captions that accompany a lot of visual content should be displayed for a little longer than the standard rule of 1 second.
