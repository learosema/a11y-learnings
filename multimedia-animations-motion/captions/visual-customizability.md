# Visual Customizability

## Media players SHOULD allow visual customization of captions.

The fact that users benefit from being able to customize the visual appearance of captions is a point made elsewhere in this module, so the idea will be presented here only briefly. Make the customization options easy to find and easy to select.

### Good examples

- The Able Player
- Windows allows users to set the styling of captions. Videos in Edge honor these settings (IE11 doesn't)
- MacOS allows customization of captions in the System Preferences. Safari honors these settings, other browsers do not.
- iOS allows customization of captions, for Safari (other browsers not supported)
