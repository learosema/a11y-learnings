# What to include in captions

## Best Practices

There is almost 100% overlap between the best practices for what to include in captions and transcripts. The course repeats the practices in both places to make them easy to find. For a quick reference, listed below are the rules that are unique to captions and the rules that are unique to transcripts.

### Unique Best Practices for Captions

- Captions SHOULD use conventional spelling, rather than attempt to write words phonetically, except when phonetic spelling is essential to the meaning of the content.
- Captions SHOULD describe sounds in terms of the sounds themselves, not the actions causing the sounds.

### Unique Best Practices for Transcripts

Important visual events MUST be described in the transcript.

## Captions MUST be verbatim for scripted content (except when intentionally creating simplified captioning for a relevant target audience, e.g. people with cognitive disabilities).

For any scripted material, captions must present all the content from the script verbatim, including any "ums" and stuttering that happens because they are intentionally included in the script.

This depends on the audience viewing the captions. This rule applies for viewers who are deaf or hard of hearing. However, if the intended audience may be people with cognitive disabilities, the captions can be simplified.

### Examples

Stuttering can be reflected in captions using repeated letters and dashes.

I c-c-can't do that right now.
"Uhh"s and "Um"s can be included with the speech text.

But, uh, wait... are you, um, sure about that?

## Captions SHOULD be verbatim for unscripted or live content (with the optional exception of stuttering or filler words -- like "um" -- when captioning the filler words reduces reading comprehension of the captions).

Whenever possible, captions should be verbatim for videos such as broadcasts, documentaries, interviews, and other unscripted media. 

However, including too many instances of stuttering and "ums" may affect the readability of captions. Use discretion as to whether to include every single utterance that occurs in the audio. Captions should be as close to verbatim as possible but should also be easy and quick to read.

## Important background sounds MUST be conveyed in the captions, preferably in [brackets] or (parentheses).

Background sounds that contribute to the mood, the scene, or the context of the video must be conveyed in the captions by describing the sound and placing the description within brackets or parentheses. Brackets or parentheses can be used to describe background noises, sound effects, background music and other significant sounds like voice tone and inflection if they contribute to the experience of watching the video. Including background sounds in the captions enhances the enjoyment and understanding of what is being presented in the video. It is important, though, not to clutter the captions with too many descriptive words as excessive wording may distract the viewer from enjoying the video in its entirety.

### Examples

- [ CRYING ]

## Speech that is spoken off-screen MUST be captured in the captions.

Any speech that is spoken off-screen (e.g., through a telephone, or other times the person is not on the screen) must be convey through the captions. For speech that occurs off screen, use italics to show viewers that the speech is coming from someone who is not in the frame.

## The identity of the person speaking MUST be identified in the captions.

When it is not obvious who is speaking in a video, the captions must identify who is speaking. Speakers needs to be identified if they are offscreen, if multiple speakers are present within the same frame, or if there are other times when a speaker in the video isn't obvious.

In captions, upper case lettering followed by a colon are generally used to create and set off the names or labels of speakers from the actual dialog or narration coming from the speaker. Mixed case lettering is usually reserved for the actual dialog or narration.

## Captions SHOULD use punctuation to convey emphasis whenever possible, rather than write extra text to explain the emphasis.

Punctuation should be used in captions to provide clarity, facilitate ease of reading, and convey emphasis whenever possible. For instance, if a speaker is yelling, instead of using descriptive wording to convey yelling, (e.g., [YELLING]), an exclamation point should be used at the end of the speaker's statement.

Using punctuation keeps captions clean and straightforward, making captions faster to read and easily understood by viewers.

### Example: Punctuation used to convey meaning

Here are some ways punctuation can be used to convey emphasis.

For questions that are incredulous, use a question mark followed by an exclamation point (?!) at the end of the statement.

```
You mean you slept outside in the rain?!
```

Meaningful pauses in speech should be indicated using ellipses.

```
I... I forgot what I was about to say.
```

Interrupted speech should be indicated with a dash at the end of the line, and any subsequent text should be presented on a new line or new caption frame.

```
I can't believe they--
```

## Captions SHOULD use conventional spelling, rather than attempt to write words phonetically, except when phonetic spelling is essential to the meaning of the content.

It is critical that captions are high in quality and accuracy. Whenever possible, conventional spelling should be used to compose captions. However, captions do need to present audio content verbatim, and there may be times where phonetic spelling is needed to properly convey audio content.

The use of slang may be one instance where conventional spelling may not present speech verbatim. The goal for captions is to present information as clearly as possible. So, conventional spelling should always be used except when it doesn't accurately convey the audio content.

### Proper use of spelling

- if in the speech the narrator says "gonna", don't write it down in formal english ("going")
- that dooes not reflect the speech of the narrator that is essential to the experience of viewing the movie.

## Captions MUST NOT reveal intentionally-withheld information in the content before the appropriate time.

Captions are supposed to convey audible information in a timely and accurate manner. So, it is critical that they do not present information before that information is provided in the audio content.

Presenting information beforehand may ruin the experience of enjoying the video and audio content. If content has not been revealed yet through audio, then it should not be revealed in the captions.

## Music SHOULD be identified by title and artist whenever possible in captions, unless doing so would be inappropriate to the content.

Music that is not part of the action, such as bluesy or eerie music being used to set the mood, should usually be identified in captions by title and artist. 

The label "MUSIC" in all upper case can be used followed by a colon to identify music, or music can be identified in conjunction with its source. Identifying music is going to depend on the context in which the music is being used. 

When music is identified in captions, the title of the song should be composed using mixed case lettering in quotations and the name of the artist follows the title of the song.

### Examples

Listed below are ways music can be identified in captions by title and artist.

```
MUSIC: "Canon in D" by Johann Pachelbel
HE HUMS "Sweet Caroline" by Neil Diamond.
SHE WHISTLES "Cake by the Ocean" by DNCE
THE ORCHESTRA PLAYS "Blue Danube" by Johann Strauss
```

For music that is not part of the action, but sets the mood, use descriptive captions to identify the music.

```
[EERIE MUSIC]
```

## Important music lyrics SHOULD be included in captions, if relevant to the meaning of the content.

If music lyrics used in audio content contribute to the experience of hearing that content, then music lyrics should be included in the captions. Discretion should be used, though, when including music lyrics in captions. 

For instance, if the lyrics are intertwined with speech, it better to identify, or label, the music and caption the speech instead of presenting both lyrics and speech. 

When music lyrics are captioned, though, they should be presented verbatim and set off with music notes at the beginning and end of each line to indicate the lines are being sung and not spoken.

### Example

When music lyrics are sung, music notes should be used at the beginning and end of the caption line to denote singing. If notes aren't present, viewers may think the words are being spoken.

```
♪ O say can you see ♪
```

## When speech is inaudible or difficult to perceive clearly, the captions SHOULD say so, using neutral language.

When speech is too difficult to decipher or when the audio in inaudible, the captions should state this directly using neutral language. Avoid using language like "unintelligible speech" to describe difficult or inaudible speech, but instead use something such as "inaudible" or "unclear."

### Example

```
(inaudible whispers)
```

## Strong language SHOULD be retained and not edited out of captions, whenever possible, OR SHOULD be bleeped or muted to match style or content requirements of the intended audience or context.

If strong language is used in the speech, then the language should be included in the captions. For times that strong language is edited, though, the captions should reflect the editing. For instance, if the strong language is bleeped out completely, then the word BLEEP should be used.

If part of the word is muted, the ellipses or dashes can be used between the first and last letters of the word to reflect the dipping of sound. For words that are dubbed, use the substitute word in the captions.

### Example

If strong language is bleeped out, then the word "BLEEP" should be used to substitute the language.

```
What the BLEEP were you thinking?
```

If a word is muted, dashes can be used to reflect the muting.

```
I can't believe I fell for your s---!
```

## Captions SHOULD indicate when speech is whispered or mouthed.

If speech is whispered or mouthed, the captions should denote this as such. The best way to indicate whispering or mouthing is to use an uppercase label before the dialog.

The label can appear within parentheses or without parentheses followed by a colon. Parentheses can be used around the dialog, too, to indicate whispering; but too much whispered or mouthed dialog in parentheses can make captions look congested.

## Captions SHOULD describe sounds in terms of the sounds themselves, not the actions causing the sounds.

When there are significant sounds in the audio, captions should describe the sounds themselves as opposed to describing what or who causes the sounds.

- Good: (sniff) Mm...
- Bad: (The girl sniffs the bread) Mm...
