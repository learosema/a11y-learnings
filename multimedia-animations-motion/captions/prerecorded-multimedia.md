# Pre-recorded multimedia

## Overview
Any time information is presented through audio, especially in videos, you will need to provide an alternative to audience members who are deaf or hard of hearing in order for them to access that information. For video and audio content, equivalent access comes through providing synchronized captions. Without captions, people who are deaf or hard of hearing will be unable to access audible information when viewing prerecorded video and audio, or access immediate audible information through live video and audio presentations and live audio-only presentations.

## All prerecorded video MUST have synchronized captions.

Captions make the dialog and narration accessible to deaf audiences. The captions must include all of the dialog and narration. The captions must also identify who is speaking, to eliminate any possible confusion. If there are other important sounds — such as applause, laughter, etc. — the caption should indicate those sounds, either in brackets or in parentheses.

The greatest amount of user-defined flexibility in captions can be achieved with WebVTT opens in a new window (the Web Video Text Tracks Format). Some browsers, such as Safari on OS X and on iOS, allow users to define their captioning preferences at the operating system level. They can set font size, color, background color, and typeface. Every time a video plays with WebVTT captions, the video player will honor the person's preferences. Storing the caption preferences in a centralized location in the operating system is convenient for the users, who won't have to choose settings every time they watch a new video.
