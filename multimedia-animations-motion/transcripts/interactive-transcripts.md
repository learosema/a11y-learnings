# Interactive Transcripts

There are a number of benefits to incorporating interactive transcripts along with video and audio content. Interactive transcripts allow users to search videos and navigate to anywhere in the video by selecting a sentence or a word in the transcript.

Not only are interactive transcripts great for accessibility and usability, but they also are great for SEO since search engines will be able to crawl through the transcript text present on a web page.
