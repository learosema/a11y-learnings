# Methods of Presenting Transcripts

## Method 1: Place the transcript directly on the page with the audio or video player.

Placing a transcript inline with the document allows for easy access. Anyone can view it, copy the text from it, and search for it. The search results will lead people directly to the page with the video.

- Good Example: Video with Transcript Below

## Method 2: Provide a link to the transcript.

- Good Example: Put link to transcript below video

## Method 3: Provide an interactive transcript, allowing users to access specific places within the video or audio content.
