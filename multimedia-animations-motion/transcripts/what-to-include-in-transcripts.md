# What to Include in Transcripts

## Best Practices

There is almost 100% overlap between the best practices for what to include in captions and transcripts. The course repeats the practices in both places to make them easy to find. For a quick reference, listed below are the rules that are unique to captions and the rules that are unique to transcripts.

## Unique Best Practices for Captions

- Captions SHOULD use conventional spelling, rather than attempt to write words phonetically, except when phonetic spelling is essential to the meaning of the content.
- Captions SHOULD describe sounds in terms of the sounds themselves, not the actions causing the sounds.

## Unique Best Practices for Transcripts
- Important visual events MUST be described in the transcript.

## Transcripts MUST be verbatim for scripted content.

If the audible content presented is based on a script, then the transcript must present all the content from the script verbatim, including any stuttering, "uhs" and "ums" that occurs because they are intentionally included in the script.

### Good Example: Stuttering and "Um"s in Transcripts

Use repeated letters and dashes to mimic stuttering in transcripts.

```
I c-c-can't do that right now.
```

Any "uh"s and "um" should be included in the transcript if they are part of the script.

```
But, uh, wait... are you, um, sure about 
```

## Transcripts SHOULD be verbatim for unscripted or live content (with the optional exception of stuttering or filler words -- like "um" -- when transcribing the filler words reduces reading comprehension of the transcript).

For videos such as broadcasts, interviews, and other unscripted content, transcripts should be verbatim. But including a lot of "ums" and stuttering may inhibit the readability of the transcript. Compose transcripts verbatim as much as possible, but skim back if too many utterances interfere with how the transcript is read.

## Important visual events MUST be described in the transcript.

Since the target audience for transcripts are people who are deafblind, it is important that the transcript describes important visual information that takes place on-screen, especially if the visual content contributes to the meaning and understanding of what is being presented.

This concept is similar to using an audio description track for a video. People who are deafblind cannot see the content, so it is critical that visual events are described in the transcript for this audience to access that information.

## Important background sounds MUST be conveyed in transcripts, preferably in [brackets] or (parentheses).

It is critical that non-speech information like background, sound effects, background music, and other descriptions like a person's tone is included in the transcript. 

These sounds contribute to setting the mood and context of the video and audio content that's being presented. The audience should be engaged as much as possible through the transcript, and providing information about sounds helps those reading the content enjoy the content.

## Speech that is spoken off-screen MUST be captured in the transcript.

Spoken content that appears off-screen in a video must be included in the transcript and noted as such. In captions, this information is provided by italicizing the spoken language. But with a transcript, a person who is deafblind may not gather that the speech is off-screen through italics.

You can provide how the speech is being delivered through descriptive wording before the spoken text (e.g., through a telephone) or provide a label to identify the speaker.

## The identity of the person speaking MUST be identified in transcripts.

In addition to identifying speakers if they are speaking off-screen, it is important to identify speakers in transcripts if it is not obvious who is speaking. For instance, if there are multiple speakers within the video or audio content, each speaker needs to be identified in the text transcript. 

The best way to identify speakers is to use a label for the speaker (either their name or their role, e.g., like a moderator) in all caps followed a colon, then compose the speech from the speaker using mixed case. Upper case is generally reserved for descriptive wording and labels, while mixed case is reserved for the actual dialog or narration coming from the speaker.

### Example

Just like with captions, speakers are identified by their name or role in all caps with a colon, followed by what they actually say.

```
MATTHEW: How are you today?

JOHN: I'm well. How are you?
```

## Transcripts SHOULD use punctuation to convey emphasis whenever possible, rather than write extra text to explain the emphasis.

To ensure that transcripts are presented in a clean format, punctuation can be used to convey emphasis instead of describing that emphasis through wording. Use punctuation if it effectively conveys emphasis in the transcript. There may be occasions where punctuation isn't quite enough. 

When that is the case, descriptive wording may need to be used to emphasize audio content. For instance, while an exclamation point can be used to convey shouting, if the shouting is intense, you may have to use the word (SHOUTING) to express the intensity.

### Examples

Punctuation can be used in a number of ways to convey meaning.

If questions are incredulous or disbelieving, a question mark followed by an exclamation point (?!) can be used at the end of the statement to convey such meaning.

```
You mean you slept outside in the rain?!
```

Use ellipses to convey meaningful pauses within speech.

```
I... I forgot what I was about to say.
```

If speech is interrupted, use dashes at the end of the line to reflect interruption. Text following the interruption should start on a new line.

```
I can't believe they--
```

## Transcripts MUST NOT reveal intentionally-withheld information in the content before the appropriate time.

The purpose of transcripts is to provide a user with quality and accurate information. If intentionally-withheld information is revealed sooner in a transcript than it should be, like a key plot point, it will spoil the experience for the user. Only reveal information in the transcript at the point it is revealed in the video or audio content.

## Music SHOULD be identified by title and artist whenever possible in transcripts, unless doing so would be inappropriate to the content.

Music that is part of the action or significant in some way to what is happening in the audio content or the audio-visual content should be identified within the transcript. Music should be identified by the title composed with mixed case lettering in quotations and the artist, if the artist is known.

It can be described either coming from its source (e.g., a person singing or a band playing) using all caps or you can use the label "MUSIC" in all caps followed by a colon to identify music in the audio content.

### Examples

Music can either be identified by a label like:

```
MUSIC: "Canon in D" by Johann Pachelbel
```

or it can be identified by its source like:

```
THE ORCHESTRA PLAYS "Blue Danube" by Johann Strauss
```

If music isn't at a part of the action, though, the way it sounds can be described as opposed to identifying it by title and artist.

```
[BLUESY MUSIC]
```

## Transcripts SHOULD indicate when speech is whispered or mouthed.

Any speech that is whispered or mouthed should be noted as such in the transcript. A descriptive label in all caps can be used either within parentheses or without parentheses followed by a colon. Again, details like this keep the audience engaged in what is taking place either in the video or audio content.

## When speech is inaudible or difficult to perceive clearly, the transcripts SHOULD say so, using neutral language.

If speech or other audio content is difficult to hear or inaudible, it should be noted as such in the transcript using neutral language. Avoid saying that the content is "unintelligible" or "incoherent babbling"; but instead, use neutral language like "inaudible" or "unclear". Provide this information either within brackets or parentheses in the text transcript.

## Strong language SHOULD be retained and not edited out of transcripts, whenever possible, OR SHOULD be bleeped or muted to match style or content requirements of the intended audience or context.

If strong language hasn't been edited out of the audio content, then it should not be edited out of the transcript. Keep strong language in the transcript if it has been spoken in the audio content. If strong language has been edited, though, then this should be reflected in the transcript. 

Words that are completed bleeped out should be replaced with the word "BLEEP" in all caps. For words that are partly muted, dashes or ellipses can be used between the first character and last character to mimic the muting effect.

### Example: Editing Strong Language

For strong language that is bleeped out completely, use the word "BLEEP" as a substitute for the language.

```
What the BLEEP were you thinking?
```

Dashes or ellipses can be used to reflect words that have been muted.

```
I can't believe I fell for your s---!
```
