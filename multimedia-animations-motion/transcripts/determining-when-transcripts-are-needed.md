# Determining When Transcripts Are Needed

## Overview

When it comes to accessibility, providing a transcript is required for prerecorded audio-only content; but it is also good for accessibility to provide a transcript for audio-visual content and video-only content as well. 

The key here is to keep in mind that there are users who are deaf and blind, and they need access to information that is both auditory in nature and visual in nature.

The best way for users who are deafblind to access information in auditory and visual formats is to provide a text-based transcript describing everything that happens in the content.

## Prerecorded multimedia (video plus audio) SHOULD have a text transcript.

Prerecorded video files containing essential information that is only conveyed visually SHOULD come with an adjacent or easily reachable full text alternative describing the important visual details

A transcript is important so that deafblind users can easily access the information using a refreshable braille output device.

A refreshable braille output device is hardware that has a row of holes, allowing small plastic pins to poke through and form braille characters.

The person reads the braille characters with the finger, then presses a button to proceed to the next line of text. The pins reconfigure into the braille characters for the new line of text.

A text transcript is essentially a text log of all of the dialog and narration in a video, similar to the captions, but available separately from the video itself. As with captions, the text transcript should identify who is speaking, plus note sounds like applause and laughter.

It should also describe other visual information â€” for example, descriptions of scenery, non-verbal communication between people, and anything else to provide an equivalent alternative to the content for people who are deafblind.

The transcript can be presented on the web page itself (usually below the video), or on a separate web page (with a link from the video page), or in a popup dialog, or even in a separate document (e.g., a text file or MS Word document)

## Prerecorded audio-only content MUST be accompanied by an easily-reachable text transcript.

To present the same information that is contained in the prerecorded audio-only content, a text transcript must be provided that details not only the dialog or narration, but any significant sounds and descriptions that occur within the audio content.

Providing essential sound information in addition to the important dialog that takes place serves as the accessible alternative to the content for people who are deafblind. Without the description of the audible content, this audience may miss important details that contribute to their understanding and enjoyment of the audio content.

When a text transcript is provided, it must also be easy to access. For instance, it could be published in the document directly under the audio player or a link to the transcript could be provided under or very close to the audio player. The transcript should not be difficult to find and access.

## Prerecorded video-only content MUST include audio descriptions OR a text transcript.

Per WCAG, video-only content MUST include either a text transcript OR audio descriptions. Again, note here that a text transcript would be the only way that a deafblind user can access the information, so this alternative is more accessible.

The transcript should essentially function as a long description of the video-only content and as the accessible alternative to the content in the video. 

While an audio description track may provide this information to people who are blind but can hear, people who are deafblind won't be able to access the information through an audio track. The only way they can access the content is if a text-based alternative is provided to them. 

The text transcript should include all visual information such as the setting, text and graphics, facial expressions and actions, and any other significant information that is visual. The transcript should be as equivalent as possible to the video-only presentation.

## A text transcript describing the visual aspects of the video SHOULD be provided for video-only content.

For people who are blind and deafblind, a text transcript that describes the important visual components in a video-only presentation should be provided. The transcript should essentially function as a long description of the video-only content and as the accessible alternative to the content in the video.

While an audio description track may provide this information to people who are blind but can hear, people who are deafblind won't be able to access the information through an audio track. The only way they can access the content is if a text-based alternative is provided to them.

The text transcript should include all visual information such as the setting, text and graphics, facial expressions and actions, and any other significant information that is visual. The transcript should be as equivalent as possible to the video-only presentation.
