# Transcripts

## Introduction

Transcripts are text-based documents that serve as an alternative to information presented in an audible and visual format. Similar to captions, transcripts extend beyond recording spoken word, as they also include important sound effects and other significant visual descriptions to provide as much of an equivalent experience as possible for those who are unable to access the auditory and visual content.

Users who are deaf or hard of hearing will benefit from a transcript of audio-only content, as will users who are deafblind. However, for video and audio content, a transcript is the only means of access users who are deafblind have to those types of content. So, when composing transcripts, the target audience should be people who are deafblind.

There are other benefits to providing transcripts with audio and video content as well. Transcripts allow all users to browse through audio and video information at their own pace.

Users can also search through the text and interact with the text (e.g., copy and paste text). Because transcripts are text-based, they are Search Engine Optimization (SEO)-friendly since search engines can crawl through the transcript text.
