# Background Audio on Web Pages

## Overview

Audio or audio-video content that begins playing automatically is not only terribly annoying for almost all users, it can especially cause problems for people with disabilities including people who use a screen reader and people with cognitive disabilities.

Individuals who use screen reading software can find it hard to hear the speech output if there is other audio playing at the same time.

This difficulty is exacerbated when the screen reader's speech output is software based (as most are today) and is controlled via the same volume control as the sound. Therefore, it is important that the user be able to turn off the background sound.

Playing audio automatically when landing on a page may affect a screen reader user's ability to find the mechanism to stop it because they navigate by listening and automatically started sounds might interfere with that navigation.

Therefore, we discourage the practice of automatically starting sounds (especially if they last more than 3 seconds). And instead, encourage that the sound be started by an action initiated by the user after they reach the page, rather than requiring that the sound be stopped by an action of the user after they land on the page.

## A mechanism MUST be provided to stop, pause, mute, or adjust volume for audio that automatically plays on a page for more than 3 seconds.

It is strongly recommended that audio is always user-initiated or, if it does play automatically, it stops after 3 seconds. This applies to content that is audio-only or multimedia, prerecorded or live. However, if any audio on a Web page does play automatically for more than 3 seconds, a mechanism must be available to either:

- Pause or stop the audio, OR
- Control the audio volume independently from the overall system volume level.

It is essential that the mechanism to control the audio be available at the top of the web page, i.e., it is the first or nearly the first thing the user will encounter on the page. Otherwise, screen reader users will find it especially difficult to locate the control if the web page audio is competing with the screen reader output.

Don't forget to ensure that the mechanism to control the audio is keyboard operable and is clearly labelled as to its purpose.
