# Background Sounds

## Introduction:

Background sounds can interfere with users' ability to understand and enjoy media presentations or an entire webpage. People affected by background sounds include people who:

- Are hard-of-hearing
- Use screen readers
- Have cognitive disabilities
- Are easily distracted

Distracting background sounds in media presentations — such as environmental noises, music, background speech, and dialog that overlaps — can make it difficult to understand the dialog or important sounds, which can be especially problematic for people who are hard of hearing.

Audio that starts automatically when a page is loaded — such as music or a news broadcast — can make it difficult or impossible for a screen reader user to hear their screen reader, find a way to turn the sound off, and then read the page.
