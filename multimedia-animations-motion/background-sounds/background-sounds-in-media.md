# Background sounds in media

## Overview

When creating audio or video content, don't let the background sounds drown out the main sounds in the video. You want people to be able to clearly hear all of the dialog, narration, and other important sounds.

This is true for all listeners but is especially true for people who are hard of hearing or who experience partial deafness. People who have a hearing disability have diminished hearing and may have difficulty understanding speech and distinguishing foreground noise from background noise.

People who use hearing aids often have difficulty with background sounds because the signals that come through the electronics of the hearing aid are not as clear as the signals that come through natural biological processes. 

Foreground noises and background noises blend together into the same sound. The sounds aren't as separate as they are for people who have their full natural hearing.

## Background Music

For the highest degree of audio accessibility, especially for people with a hearing disability, eliminate all background music entirely whenever there is dialog, narration, or other important audio content.

That being said, background music can enhance video and audio content and make it more compelling, or at least more interesting... or perhaps more annoying, depending on the choice of music!

In any case, background music is allowable, as long as it doesn't overpower or interfere with the main audio content. Consider playing the music only during breaks in the dialog, or consider dropping the volume of the music while people are talking.

## Background Noises

Background noises such as applause, traffic, waterfalls, people talking, wind, machinery, etc. can distract a great deal from the main audio content and can decrease understandability. Reduce background noises as much as possible when recording audio.

Using professional audio recording equipment can help. When recording people talking (interviews, narration, dialog, etc.), place a dedicated microphone near the speaker rather than recording from camera distance.

Built-in camera microphones are notoriously bad at capturing good audio. Use a separate microphone that can be handheld, on a headset, on a podium, placed on the speakers' lapel, on a microphone stand near the speaker, or on a boom over the speakers' heads.

In other words: invest in some high-quality sound recording equipment. Don't underestimate the importance of good sound for everyone, but especially for people with hearing disabilities.

## Background Overlapping Dialog

When two or more people talk to each other, they frequently talk at the same time, even if it's just to say "yes" or "uh-huh" or "right."

People frequently interrupt each other or begin to say their own thing as soon as they sense the other person is beginning to come to the end of a thought, even if they haven't finished the thought yet.

All of this may be common, but it makes listening to conversations harder for people with hearing disabilities, especially for those using hearing aids.

If you're recording your own audio or video, try to direct the participants to speak one at a time, if possible. 

If you're interviewing someone, it's best to refrain from saying anything at all until the other person finishes talking. The less overlapping dialog the better.

## Background sounds in prerecorded audio-only and prerecorded multimedia content SHOULD be minimized (20dB lower than foreground sounds, except for occasional sounds of no more than 2 seconds) or eliminated during narration or dialog, or a method must be available to turn off background sounds.

Ensure that background sounds in prerecorded audio-only and prerecorded multimedia do not interfere with the ability to understand the important or primary dialog or sounds in your media presentations by making sure at least one of the following is true:

- The audio does not contain any background noise at all
- Background sounds can be turned off by the user
- Background sounds are at least 20 decibels lower than (about 4 times quieter than) the primary speech or sounds

## Background sounds in live audio-only and live multimedia content SHOULD be minimized (20dB lower than foreground sounds, except for occasional sounds of no more than 2 seconds) or eliminated during narration or dialog, or a method must be available to turn off background sounds.

Although managing background audio in prerecorded media is a WCAG Level AAA success criteria, managing background audio in live media content is not mentioned by WCAG. However, often times the same principles can be applied to live media broadcasts.

There certainly are times where managing the background audio of a live media presentation is outside of the control of a media technician. Such situations include streaming a live video of an unfolding event where you are simply an observer, for example: a sporting event or a political rally.

Other times, however, managing background audio is within the influence of a media technician. With good planning, preparation, and equipment a media technician can exert a lot of control over background audio levels, such as a when a news reporter is reporting at a live event.
