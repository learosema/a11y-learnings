# Determining When Sign Language Interpretation is Needed

## Overview
In terms of pure accessibility, adding sign language interpretation to videos is always a good thing. Your deaf audiences will greatly appreciate it.

In terms of obligations, the WCAG requirement for sign language only comes into play at Level AAA, and only for prerecorded multimedia presentations. Methods do exist to provide sign language support for prerecorded and live audio-only content and live multimedia content, but they are not required by any accessibility guidelines or regulatory requirements.

## Sign language interpretation MAY be provided for prerecorded multimedia (video plus audio).

When recording video content of speeches and live events where sign language interpreters may be present, consider including the sign language interpreter within the same video frame, or if that is not possible, in a supplemental video to help those who understand sign language better than captions or transcripts.

In all other cases, the sign language interpretation can be provided by including a video of the interpretation via picture-in-picture at the bottom corner of the video or as a separate, synchronized video. See the page on Methods of Presenting Sign Language Interpretation for more information.

## Sign language interpretation MAY be provided for prerecorded audio-only content.

Supplementing a prerecorded audio-only presentation, such as a podcast or a prerecorded radio show, with sign language interpretation requires that a synchronized video of the sign language interpretation and the audio be created and provided separately from the audio-only file.

## Sign language interpretation MAY be provided for live multimedia (video plus audio) content.

When shooting a video of speeches and live events where sign language interpreters may be present, consider including the sign language interpreter in the same video frame as the speaker. If that is not feasible, you may provide the interpretation in a supplemental video in a different viewport or overlaid on the main video image.

## Sign language interpretation MAY be provided for live audio-only content.

Supplementing a live audio-only presentation with sign language interpretation requires that a separate video feed be provided to show the live sign language interpretation.
