# Sign Language Interpretation

## Introduction:
Many people from the Deaf and hard-of-hearing community prefer sign language to captions. For some people who are deaf, sign language is their first and most fluent language, meaning they may understand sign language better than written language. For this group, sign language can offer a more expressive representation of live multimedia, particularly in the case of a fast-moving scene.

There are a number of different sign languages used by the Deaf and hard-of-hearing community based on where the community is in the world. In the United States, American Sign Language (ASL) is the most common. Other sign languages include British Sign Language (BSL), Japanese Sign Language... and many, many more. In fact, there are almost as many variants of sign language as there are countries in the world. 

The [Wikipedia article on sign language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sign_languages) estimates that there are about 300 sign languages in use around the world. As a result, sign language cannot be localized as easily as closed captions or a transcript.
