# Methods of Presenting Sign Language Interpretation

## Method 1: Picture in Picture (PiP) in the video itself

The most common way of presenting sign language interpretation, especially in professionally-produced videos, is by using Picture in Picture (PiP) technology. The sign language interpreter is typically shown in one corner of the video, or side-by-side with the original video.

An alternative way to prepare a picture-in-picture sign language interpretation would be to include the rectangular background behind the interpreter. In some ways, this can be an even better approach, because the background can be cleaner, without visual interference from items in the main video's background.

## Method 2: As a separate synchronized video

In video players that support it, you may be able to allow users to turn sign language interpretation on and off, and show the two synchronized video streams simultaneously.

## Method 3: Include the interpreter in the original video

If there is a sign language interpreter in the same room as the speaker, the video can capture both the interpreter and the speaker at the same time, in the same video frame.

This eliminates the need for any post-production work to add an interpreter after the fact. It's the easiest way to broadcast live sign language interpretation.
