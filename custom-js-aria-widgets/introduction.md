# Custom JavaScript/ARIA Widgets

## Introduction

This module covers a wide range of topics related to creating custom widgets with ARIA (accessible rich internet applications) methods. In order to create a custom widget successfully, you have to know techniques related to ARIA itself (such as name, role, value, description, and live regions), and keyboard accessibility (all the basic concepts, plus an understanding of the ARIA keyboard model).

The section entitled "ARIA Widget Examples" shows live examples of these principles in action. The accessibility features of the widgets are explained in detail. You may copy and use the code in your own web development, or just learn from the accessibility patterns in the widgets.
