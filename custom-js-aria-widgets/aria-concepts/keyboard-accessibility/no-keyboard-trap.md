# No Keyboard Trap

## Overview

You want keyboard users to be able to:

- Get to all actionable elements (links, buttons, form elements, etc.)
- Use the actionable elements
- Move past the actionable elements and continue on to the rest of the web page.

Keyboard traps occur when the last step is not possible. If users can't tab out of an object, or past it, that's a real problem. They may be forced to use a keyboard shortcut to go to the address bar, then navigate backward through the page, or they may have to close the browser entirely and start over, depending on how completely the keyboard trap prevents them from leaving.

The most frequent offender is Flash (particularly Flash objects in Firefox on a Mac), but poorly-conceived JavaScript can also create a keyboard trap.
